<p><strong>Saturday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Zby_Sav6Y4">How Vinay Malge became the catalyst for Bidar&rsquo;s heritage revival | DH Changemakers 2025</a></li>
<li>tried osm mapping</li>
<li>did washing machine repairing at home with papa and mummy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sunday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DFSsmjuscyh/?img_index=1">session - Biology of Money in the morning</a></li>
<li>wrote summary about session published <a href="https://learningwala.in/blog/biology-of-money/">blog post</a> and my prep note.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Monday</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>watched arun ganesh&rsquo;s interview</li>
<li>spent time to study adhavana&rsquo;s work</li>
<li>I tried OSM Go app</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Had short call with Thejesh GN about how to do survey of biodiversity / tree mapping.
he shared tool called kobo tool box (<a href="https://www.kobotoolbox.org/">https://www.kobotoolbox.org/</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vidit came from the canada for few months. He is super confused and stressed about going back to canada.He is analyzing that should he stay in india and do the job or should he go back to canda and do hardwork to save money and come back.. it&rsquo;s classic immigration conundrum. We had long discussion, we went to vadodra, had lunch at nice gujarati thali restaurant called Kathivadi Darbar - Alkapuri. After that we went to buy Monitor screen for me. It was a long pending task to finish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>we bought refurbished Dell E2421HN 24inch monitor in 5k and logitech wireless mouse and keyboard (K275) . I was very confusing during the shopping, I was comparing online price, which brand and technology to buy and everything&hellip; finally i took a plunge. it&rsquo;s nice quality not very slim and attractive like what I see online but it is decent. I am trying this new keyboard. It&rsquo;s a mechanical keyboard. After using thinkpad&rsquo;d keyboard it is difficult to shift to any other keyboard. let&rsquo;s see how it goes. I think I will like it in sometime.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Wednesday</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>spent time in researching about the monitor. It is my habit. Which now I don&rsquo;t like.
I keep researching and justifying my decision. In this case I keep justifying my step to not buying IPS monitor because it was costly (8k) and I don&rsquo;t need it because I am not doing gaming or graphic designing work. But when ever I read that IPS gives good color accuracy and it is good for eyes. At that time my mind goes mad and it tells me to go back to shop and give back the monitor and buy another one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This confusion is very interesting. I am experimenting with it for low stack environment so I can learn and apply it in other situation also. I read about e - ink screens which seems best for the low eye strain and also for distraction free work.
People are making <a href="https://www.modos.tech/">e- ink monitors</a> and <a href="https://daylightcomputer.com/">tabs</a>. Some people are trying gray scale on their existing monitors and phones. I also tried gray scale on my ubuntu device. It took some time to find out right tool to do system wide gray scale. Thanks to chat GPT. It was fun experiment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But this whole thing is about how brain works. How we are taking a decisions. What we prioritize and why. I was remembering Paras Chopra&rsquo;s mental models. Also thinking about cognitive basis. finally I had chat with chat GPT which gave me some peace :)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Thursday</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Abhijit was in Vadodra to take session at oasis. I went to vadodara to meet him. We had a lunch at kathiwadi darbar. This is second time I am going to kathiwadi darbar in same week. After lunch we went to visit Aditya&rsquo;s maker space &lsquo;Forrest of us&rsquo;. They are doing very nice work. I am happily jalousie. At that day they were working on wast management of Vadodra marathon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I also return the monitor I have bought. I had talk with suchakra and he suggested to buy new <a href="https://www.amazon.in/LG-IPS-sRGB-Height-Adjust-Display/dp/B0BRQT57RC/ref=mp_s_a_1_10?crid=1H4NH4KLPIHXP&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9._T_qxcACiBpvKYmQSvgLsW4s0T3usIbvmqF8SRaqTAZgmWnAot7QBFC4w_L_7Yk126yZcmZo6wC6F2N4IFh4xu99ugCCcUuPqgybu-fdOhIPmTlBT3wDNqCPncem5er2gaNCjJlSokyZNYZY3G494MUKaWlimUjKyarCJZYXNvLuPohREB4SqZtimtiIB8pG5HbomJmwj40-e08oBVqQ6A.3w1owtm-qWWQ-HYXuIYhe21SIgrTQyiXSvKTTYbZyuc&dib_tag=se&keywords=benq+qhd+monitor+24+inches&nsdOptOutParam=true&qid=1738175044&sprefix=benq+qhd+monitor%2Caps%2C459&sr=8-10">LG QHD monitor</a> which is good for reading, writing, coding. So I ordered at same shop in Vadodra. Suchakra also sponsored part of the total amount of the monitor as a marriage gift :) Very thoughtful gift&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Got msg Radhika from Balgokulam. They are ready to hire my as learning facilitator. I was waiting for this confirmation since last 2 months. Finally it came. Now we need to finalize where should we go ? Kanisa or ahemdabd ?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>in last weekly note I have written that we will not go for jashdan and join kanisa but now game is changed.</p>
<p>→ Stability &amp; social life : ahemdabad is ok ok city. We can come to vadodara in two hours.
→ Finance : salary + grant<br>
→ Stimulation at work / meaningful work : it&rsquo;s seems interesting. Nature education for kindergarten children + I can continue sakha fellowship and local khoji work in vadodra. I can learn research part. It will be corporate style setting but I need to be flexible.
→ Nidhi&rsquo;s work / working together :  she can come to balgokulam, she can join anusandhan ngo , we can find new places</p>
<p>we had a long call with Mitali ben. She also suggested to go ahemdabd.
Now I need to think about winding up DEFY work in march and find out home and everything in ahemdabd. Still I am confuse, unsure, let&rsquo;s see.. universe will take care.</p>
<p><strong>Friday</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Had a call with Ravi bhai</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mostly spent time for office meetings/work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>overall good week,</p>

<p>Me and Nidhi are thinking about giving proper name and visual identity to our nature education work. Learningwala is there but nidhi is feeling that, it is my brand and my work, she is not feeling that she is part of it. So we have decided to create something new which we both can hold and nurture.</p>
<p>I was thinking about different names.. KhojBeen Mandali suck to my mind. Nidhi also liked it. I started reaching out to people seeking help in visual identity. Rachita called me and gave some ideas about how to start. I had a chat with Ipsa Jain, Ashra, Nipun Prabhakar, Jinal, Chaitali and few other folks about the same.</p>

<p><strong>Overall mood and other things</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Overall I am happy. Work at DEFY is going well.</li>
<li>I am happy that my and nidhi&rsquo;s friends are coming to our wedding</li>
<li>After eliminating all the options we have decided to go to <a href="https://www.ntpatelhighschool.org/">Mitali ben&rsquo;s school</a> from march. <a href="https://gopaldham.org/">Gopaldham</a> option is still open, today morning I had call with Varun. He is ready to accommodate both of us with salary we are expecting. The only thing is it is very remote area and we will feel alone. Here mitali ben is there, vadodra is near by so it will work out. I told varun that we will meet after 15th feb. We will visit the school so we can get idea.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mostly we will take a risk and go to Mitali ben&rsquo;s school :)</p>
<p><strong>Process of elimination :</strong></p>

<p>10th : Bharat and dhara came. We again went to gajara cafe, ate pavbhaji near sursagar..</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>they were student of alternative school near rajkot / chotila calle &lsquo;K shala&rsquo;. I use to do BA sociology from surastra university around 2017. During that time I use to visit this school. Bharat came to my place when I was working in Bhuj. I was so happy to see them after so many years. Our relationship was not like teacher - students. We are friends. I am so happy that they are now working with children and trying to create environment which they got during k shala. They also shared the updates about other students that they are doing well in their respective fields and some of them are getting married soon.</p>
<p>chetan is in ahemdabad running organic milk startup with Srishti (Prof Anil)
shailesh is working in nephropathy centers
Vibhu is also working in nisarg upchar kendra
Nikunj is not doing anything as per them :)
Deepak is working in factory
Harshad is interested in mountaineering and he is working as guide for different groups</p>
<p>Bharat and Dhara are going to work at shishukunj foundation, Bhuj. They are going to work with children from gov schools. Me &amp; Nidhi were thinking to visit them and do some nature education work with them. I felt that they are thinking limited scope of work like doing games and art activity with children. We can do lot more. We will talk to them. I it just thought, I never seen them working so I might be wrong.</p>

<li>During Jan 2024 to Dec 2024 me and Nidhi did worked with different groups of children, facilitated worskhops, orgnized residential camps and more. I tried to capture all our activities in one photo report - <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAGaq8utmtg/O439oGkID5vYzoAcNmCFkQ/view?utm_content=DAGaq8utmtg&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=h2c229f4669#1">Gulmohar</a></li>
<li>I wrote <a href="https://learningwala.in/blog/2024-reflections/">2024 year end reflections</a></li>
<li>I wanted to work with young people for so long. I wanted to design fellowship kind of program where they get opportunity to work on real life projects, travel, meet people outside of their circle. Finally it worked out. Friends from sai&rsquo;s angel foundation + Me &amp; Nidhi are working on something called sakha fellowship. We are launching it on 12th Jan. I spent time on developing all the ideas related to it.</li>
<li>My health went down, fever, low blood pressure</li>
<li>I am getting married on 4th Feb. Preparations are going in full swing. On 5th Jan relatives are going to come at home to write invitation card (Kankotri in Gujarati) so I helped parents to prepare for the same.</li>
<li>I did calculation of all funding and other money I have and how much I utilize in what.
Didn&rsquo;t get proper calculation for salary money (money apart from grant).</li>

<p>1st Dec : we (Mihir, Nidhi and Mitali ben) met jagdish bhai (donor of kanisa school)
2nd Dec : spent time with Nidhi at her place. We went for a brunch at Cafe Bangalore. We mostly talked about the Job and future of our work.</p>
<p>at this point we have few opportunities :</p>
<p>We have eliminated these :</p>
<ul>
<li>creative school and other alternative schools in BLR</li>
<li>Moving to Cooore / Joining youcan</li>
</ul>
<p>Current options :</p>
<ul>
<li>Project DEFY and BeMe (Bangalore)</li>
<li>Balgokulam</li>
<li>Vapi home schooling group</li>
<li>getting funds and work at Mitali ben&rsquo;s place</li>
<li>going to bhopal, find out some work at Eklavya</li>
<li>Shishukunj, Bhuj</li>
<li>varun khimani jashdan - gopaldham learning center</li>
</ul>
<p>right now we both are feeling that Bangalore option is great financially and growth wise
but my family (specifically father) wants that we stay in Vadodra and do work here. We are feeling helpless.
we want to be near to our parents but other side there is a financial struggle, we will not get money in Vadodara.
we can definitely do good work if we get funding. let&rsquo;s how it goes.</p>
<ul>
<li>4th to 7th dec - APU - Wipro Partners Forum 2024</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>saturday evening Mitali ben came home and had a talk with Me and Nidhi sapratly
after that we went to padra, had a talk with my parents. Main three things</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>golu should not live here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nidhi should come padra often (once a week) and help mummy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I need to save money / they needed some financial clearity</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>meeting went well.</p>
<p><strong>Sunday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>sunday morning me and Nidhi came to padra, satyed till evening. Evening we (Mihir, Nidhi, Golu) went to SAF (sai&rsquo;s angel foundation)
one girl got accedent there, so nidhi got occupied with that - XRay and other things.. I took session &lsquo;khoji club&rsquo; I have praposed two ideas</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>I will give seed money of 2k, start your own venture</li>
<li>tell me whcih skills you want to learn / what project you want to do</li>
</ol>
<p>most of the children opted for skill thing - cooking, music, art, computer programming, stock market, pet care and more
I am so happy to see children&rsquo;s enthusism. Now we need to find resources for them.</p>
<p>I shifited back to padra.</p>
<p><strong>Monday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nidhi went to Mitali ben&rsquo;s school</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tuesday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>office work. In evening I met <a href="https://ccl.iitgn.ac.in/team/nihar-pandya">Nihar Pandya</a> at Gulmahor</li>
<li>My blood presure got down</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Wednesday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>went to hospital</li>
<li>office work</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Thursday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>office work</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Friday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>went to nidhi&rsquo;d place and worked form there.</li>
<li>it was difficult day for me. First of telling at home that I want to go at Nidhi&rsquo;s place. I was anxious. At nidhi&rsquo;s place it was difficult for me to listen golu&rsquo;s voice. I don&rsquo;t like the rude tone and other thing is whole routine stuff.. I can&rsquo;t see him like this. I shouldn&rsquo;t give this option of gap year.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>what else ?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I randomly did msg to Yogen shah, wrong decision. His is just like I met him for so 10 years ago.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pratham work is going good. Now I am confident about writing script, making poster and editing / making video in canva.
For canva part I still take help of Archi and Neha. They are pro. I need to play more with canva to make it normal for me. Just like I tinker with my website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This sunday khoji club will not happen. I need to go for prayer of one relative. But children are very very excited. They ready with their tasks.
I see big hope to this project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Early bird approached for facilitating birdwalk in Vadodara. I am not sure we will able to do it or not. I will take final call today and email them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am learning to balance my time between work, Nidhi&rsquo;s place and parents place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>on Thursday I saw documentary on swami brahmvedantaji again. This is like 5th or 6th time. This I understood what is &lsquo;self - remembering&rsquo; and what is the technique.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>જે પણ કરો હોંશ થી કરો</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>જે પણ કરો એમાં તમારી હાજરી રહે એવી રીતે કરો</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>જે પણ કરો એમાં પણ રહેવાનું છે અને સાથે સાથે આપણું મૂળ સ્વરૂપ પણ યાદ રાખવાનું છે.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>there is real self without any filters. our ego is making this suffering more difficult.
we need to remember our true self each movement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not too much gyan. It is simple practice.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>last saturday was working</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sunday nidhi went to take a session at vinoba ashram with amit bhai. This time I stayed home. Took some rest.
If I go to a workshop it takes half of my Sunday and it&rsquo;s difficult to get a break on weekdays because of work.
It was difficult for me to decide because Nidhi needs support in session. But we had a chat and she agreed to go alone.
My evening session at sai&rsquo;s angel foundation got canceled because their office got flooded during heavy rains last to last week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monday, Tuesday - hectic days at work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wednesday we went to Nisarag Upchar Kendra (Vinoba Ashram) to take naturopathy treatment for me and nidhi. It was a long due.
We got a new routine and diet. We need to eat Millets, fruits, soups :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thursday, Friday - again busy days at work. Following a new routine is fun + a little difficult. Especially since there are three people at home.
all three need to eat different things. Golu don&rsquo;t like millets and things we eat without masala. So we need to cook for everyone differently.
Nidhi and my diet has some common elements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nidhi is trying to manage new routine and her work (taking sessions with children and planning for the sessions). Right now most of her time is going in to cooking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the rains washing machine got damaged. Repair guy came yesterday and fixed it. It was a panel issue. I didn&rsquo;t give much attention..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>at the parents front : Mitali ben had a talk with my parents and now we need to go to meet them on sunday. I am super anxious about what I will talk about&hellip;
According to mitali ben they are ready for marriage.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>They just want</p>
<ul>
<li>ki me Nidhi ko financial support na karu apne pese bacha ke rakhu :) basically financial security</li>
<li>Nidhi jab bhi mere familiy valo se mile thoda friendly tarike se mile</li>
<li>they are ok ki hum bahar rahe..</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how it goes.</p>
<ul>
<li>This Sunday I have my &lsquo;khoji club&rsquo; session planned.</li>
</ul>
<p>What else ?</p>
<p>I am super frustrated with golu’s behavior. Talking in loud voice
Talking rudely with nidhi, seeing everything from lens of money.
Where I will get more money
Which thing is more costly, I want to grab that because it is costly = good / status
Not getting uncomfortable in anything</p>
<p>He is not following routine at all, all day watching reels or tarak mehta.. All day putting earphones in ears. Waking up like 10 - 11 everyday…</p>
<p>Actually I am ok with routine because, eventually he will get bored and find some activity to learn.
We gave some options like gym, swimming, coaching class for CUET exam, Ankur warikoo’s online course about communication, self learning math and other subjects</p>
<p>He is doing that online course sometimes, and sometimes he does self learning for math. other options are on hold because of rain and willingness
But it is like 2 hrs a day.. All the other time goes on mobile..</p>
<p>I am doubtful that mobile phones will not give the opportunity to get bored.
Let’s see…</p>
<p>Now I am feeling that we should have not called him here and let him do the college he was planning to do. Now it is too late</p>
<p>Few days ago my anger bursted and said something to golu which he didn’t like.
Today I will try to write a sorry email to him.</p>

      <description>17th to 24th August 2024 &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Sunday Nidhi and I took a workshop at Vinoba Ashram on biodiversity. It was in collaboration with Amit bhai (paper ball education and Vinoba ashram). I was stressed because of home stuff and not sure if I can facilitate it or not. I was thinking about not going to the workshop but nidhi was very keen that you need to come. But I sent a msg to Amit bhai saying that I will not co facilitate, I am not in a good state of mind.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id="17th-to-24th-august-2024">17th to 24th August 2024</h4>
<p>&ndash;&gt; Sunday Nidhi and I took a workshop at Vinoba Ashram on biodiversity. It was in collaboration with Amit bhai (paper ball education and Vinoba ashram). I was stressed because of home stuff and not sure if I can facilitate it or not. I was thinking about not going to the workshop but nidhi was very keen that you need to come. But I sent a msg to Amit bhai saying that I will not co facilitate, I am not in a good state of mind.In the morning we went, and when I saw children I couldn’t resist to go on the floor 🙂</p>
<p>Also I wanted to support Nidhi. It went well. It was not a very well planned session but it was the first session and everything was new for Nidhi so she did planning according to her understanding. I gave very less time to planning. Next time we will do more tight planning.</p>
<p>I can see Nidhi growing as a facilitator. She is opening up slowly. She needs to learn how to judge the group and decide the activities.</p>
<p>Working with Amit bhai is a little bit difficult because of his expectations and ideas about the activities. But his intention is good so we will figure it out. We will figure out a way to work together.</p>
<p>Now the next workshop is on 2nd september so we need to work on the same. Topic is - ecosystem and interconnectedness</p>
<p>&ndash;&gt; Monday we were at home only, did home set up the kitchen and other stuff.</p>
<p>Tuesday we went to the office, Nidhi had a meeting with Amit bhai. Reflected on the session.</p>
<p>I did my pratham’s work. Evening we went to a restaurant. Amit bhai shared that Gulmahor will be not available for september so we have decided to work from home only.</p>
<p>&ndash;&gt; Wed, Thu, Fri and Sat - not been to the office. Worked from home only.</p>
<p>&ndash;&gt; Work wise it was a good productive week. I completed most of my tasks.</p>
<p>&ndash;&gt; Whole week I woke around 7.30 to 7.40 (except today. Today I woke up at 8.13) and did stretching, reading for some time. Nidhi also woke up around 8 whole week. She also did stretching. I felt so happy that she did it without being negative. Today we did suryanamaskar together. It was fun.</p>
<p>Nidhi made breakfast - lunch and dinner everyday. It was very good for my stomach and eating together was fun.</p>
<p>&ndash;&gt; We got Jio wifi on thursday. Now I can attend office calls without any limits and yes we can watch tv without any worry about data limit. It is useful and tempting both. We saw lage raho munna bhai and all india rank together (Golu, Nidhi, Mihir)</p>
<p>&ndash;&gt; Working with golu is tough for me. Waking up late, being sleepy and not active in the morning, watching TV or mobile all the time, connecting everything with money - fame - success, not focusing on tasks, being negative in doing physical activity. Eating chilen, not sleeping without AC. I took all the things on my ego. I got stressed about how we will go forward with this mindset.</p>
<p>Yesterday we had a good discussion about the future plan. How to do projects and prepare for the exam. We saw all the courses on the internet but he is not sure what to do. So we decided to do projects and prepare for the common university entrance exam.</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see how everything goes. I am hopeful. I also want to learn how to work with teenagers of this background.</p>
<p>I saw that entrepreneurship is a common subject we like so we will do something about it. Today I gave him a challenge to sit without doing anything for two hours. Let&rsquo;s see he can do it. I will give 1k if I can. I know I should not introduce money in this but I can&rsquo;t help but think that other options are closed right now.</p>
<p>&ndash;&gt; What else ? Other things are ok. Whenever I think about situations at home, I feel stressed so I am engaging myself in other tasks. Not thinking about it. I am looking forward to the session at sai’s angle - saturday club. Yesterday Neha from Moinee foundation called me for curriculum development work, I am looking forward to that also.</p>

<li>Nidhi worked on session planning</li>
<li>House huntting</li>
</ul>
<p>Sent this email to namrata di and vishal bhai :</p>
<p>આપણે વાત કરવા માટેનો સમય સેટ નથી થઇ રહ્યો એટલે મેં વિચાર્યું કે ઈમેલ જ કરું, શાંતિ થી પોતાના સમયે વાંચી શકાય</p>
<p><strong>અત્યારે શું ચાલી રહ્યું છે :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>મારુ પ્રથમ માં કામ ધીમે ધીમે ચાલી રહ્યું છે. મારે વેસ્ટ મેન્જમેન્ટ, કલામેન્ટ ચેન્જ વિષય પર વિવિધ વિડીયો માટેની સ્ક્રીપ્ટ લખવાની હોય છે. મારો તો સ્ક્રીપ્ટ લખવાનો પહેલો અનુભવ છે એટલે મને થોડી વાર લાગે, બ્રેઈન સ્ટોર્મ કરવા જોઈએ, ક્રિએટિવ કામ છે પણ અહીં આ લોકો એકદમ ફેક્ટરી અપ્રોચ વાપરે છે એટલે મને ખુબ સ્ટ્રેસ થાય.  ટિમ આખી રીમોટ્લી કામ કરે છે, એના ફાયદા છે પણ ગેરફાયદા પણ છે. કોઈ કલ્ચર અથવા કામ સિવાય વાત નહિ.
એક વખત રેઝિગ્નેશન આપવાની કોશિશ કરી પણ ટીમ લિડે કીધું કે તારું કામ બદલી નાખીએ એટલે તને થોડી મજા આવે :) આમ કરી કરી ને ચાલે છે. કેટલીક વાર બધું અર્થ વગરનું લાગે, કોઈક વાર નવું શીખવા મળે છે, મન ઉપર કામ થઇ રહ્યું છે..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>નિધિ અહીં પાછી આવી ગઈ છે. એની ફેલોશીપ નું કામ શરૂ કરશે, અમિત ભાઈ અને બીજા એક બે મિત્રો બાળકો શોધવા માં મદદ કરી રહ્યા છે. અત્યારે 3 લર્નિંગ સેન્ટર ઉપર બાળકો સાથે નેચર એજ્યુકેશન પર કામ થશે એવું ગોઠવ્યું છે.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>હું અહીં રામેશ્વરી બેન ની સંસ્થાના બાળકો સાથે થોડો સમય વિતાવું છું. લોકલ ખોજી કરીને &lsquo;લોકલ સિવિક પ્રોબ્લેમ સોલવિંગઃ&rsquo; ઉપર એક કોર્સ લીધો. આ ગ્રુપ આપણા 12+ ના ગ્રુપ જેવું જ છે. એમની સાથે નાના નાના પ્રોજેક્ટ કરું છું.
એ લોકો માટે ઇન્ટર્નશિપ ડિઝાઇન કરી રહ્યા છે. હું વિચારતો હતો કે બીમી ના બાળકો પણ અહીં ઇન્ટર્નશિપ કરવા માટે આવી શકે.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ઈમ્પના અને સાત્વિકા સાથે અઠવાડિયા માં એક વખત વાત થઇ જાય છે. પોડકાસ્ટ વાળા પ્રોજેક્ટ પાછો શરૂ કરવાનો છે. કોશિશ કરી રહ્યા છે.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ઘરે શું ચાલી રહ્યું છે :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ઘણી વાર મને લાગે કે અમે વડોદરા આવવાનો નિર્ણય ખોટો લઇ લીધો. એ વખતે નિધિ ને થિન્ક ટેક માં ન ફાવ્યું, એ બીમી માં સેટ થશે કે નહિ એ મને ડાઉટ હતો, ઘરે મમ્મી ને અને પપ્પા ની તબિયત સારી નહોતી રહેતી, સગાઈ માટે પણ અમે લોકો અહીં એમની સામે હતા તે સારું રહ્યું , જો અહીં રહેવા ન આવ્યા હોત તો સગાઈ માટે અઘરું પડત. આ બધું જોતા વડોદરા આવવાનો નિર્ણય બરાબર લાગે છે. પણ બીમી ને ખુબ મિસ કરું છું હું. મને ઘણા વર્ષો પછી મારે જેવું કામ કરવું હતું એના માટેનું પ્લેટફોર્મ મળ્યું હતું, પણ હું ચાહતો હોવા છતાં કામ ન કરી શક્યો.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>નિધિ હમણાં લગ્ન ન થાય ત્યાં સુધી અલગ ઘર માં રહેવાની છે. એના ઘરે થી સાથે રહેવાની પરમિશન નથી, મારા ઘરે એવો કઈ વાંધો નથી પણ&hellip; + એનો નાના ભાઈએ 12 પછી એક વર્ષનો બ્રેક લીધો છે, એટલે એ પણ રહેવા આવવા માંગે છે એટલે એવું સેટ કર્યું છે હમણાં. ઘર શોધી રહ્યા છે.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ઘરે એક દિવસ મેં નિધિ સાથે વાસણ ઘસ્યા એમાં મમ્મી - પપ્પા ને બહુ ખરાબ લાગ્યું. એમને એવું થયું કે નિધિ મારી પાસે કામ કરાવે છે. મેં કીધું કે અમે બંને મળીને કામ કરી રહ્યા છે. પણ એ ન માન્યા, નિધિ કઈ મને ફોર્સ કરીને નહોતી બોલાવતી. બીજી રીતે પણ એ લોકો એવી એક્સપેક્ટેશન રાખે કે નિધિ જોબ ના કરે બસ ઘરનું કામ કરે.. પપ્પા ને તો  હજી આ સંબંધ ગમતો જ નથી, પૈસાની બાબતે પણ એમને એવું થાય.. નિધિ ની જોબ નહોતી ત્યારે મેં નિધિ ને મેં થોડી મદદ કરી હતી એમાં એમને વાંધો પડી ગયો.. કેમ એને પૈસા આપ્યા.. આ છોકરી બધા પૈસા પડાવી લેશે ને આવું બધું.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>મને બહુ જ ગુસ્સો આવે, પણ કોને કહું કેવી રીતે આમાં આગળ વધુ ખબર નથી પડતી, મને લાગતું હતું મમ્મી સમજશે, એ પણ આવી જ બધી વાતો કરે છે. તો હમણાં આ બધી વાતનો સ્ટ્રેસ ચાલે છે.</p>
<p>ચાલો હમણાં આટલી અપડેટ રાખીએ, પછી પાછા વધારે વાત કરીશું</p>
<p>આવજો</p>

What is the update ? I told lie to my team lead and other team member about my father&rsquo;s health. So I can get relief from work. It was very hectic and in that stressed situation I was not able to think what else I can do so I did this.. I felt guilty for some time but after one point of time I felt ok.)</p>

At that point of time I was not feeling confident and comfortable about putting this in my notes but now I am feeling that I should put it so I can document the important incident of my life. What is the update ? - before weekly note 25, my all the weekly updates were publicly available to read on my website, it is still available but I changed the link path from the home page so now you can only reach to the notes if I share the link with you or you tinker with blog url. In weekly note 24, I mentioned about workplace &lsquo;Pratham&rsquo; and about my team lead. I didn&rsquo;t mentioned the name of any person. Some how my team lead read the post. i don&rsquo;t know how, I didn&rsquo;t share it on any social media. she read the post and informed the HR. We had a call with HR about the policy where I can&rsquo;t mention pratham&rsquo;s name of or any work related things on my blog. You can read how I was feeling at that point of time in my msg to my team lead after the call.)</p>

      <description>From 1st June to 8th June Mostly did office (Pratham&amp;rsquo;s) work. Had a call with my team lead. Had meetings with the team for a new content development project. I am not enjoying work at Pratham fully because of sevral reasons. Pratham is a big org. Culture of the org feels more corporate (I worked at eklavya and BeMe. Nobody can bit that culture) work of developing content sometimes feels meaningless and espacially when you are working on some CSR project whcih is demanding a specific kind of content which is not alligned with your thought process.</description>

<ol>
<li>Pratham is a big org. Culture of the org feels more corporate (I worked at eklavya and BeMe. Nobody can bit that culture)</li>
<li>work of developing content sometimes feels meaningless and espacially when you are working on some CSR project whcih is demanding a specific kind of content which is not alligned with your thought process.</li>
<li>Sometimes I am technically not skilled enough to develop content using AI tools. Young people in my team use AI like a pro. I sometimes run out of learning new skills and hold on to what I already know.</li>
<li>I mostly worked in small teams. Worked directly with the founder or team leads. where people know my skills and they value it. Give recongtion. Here I am one of hundrads. so I am feeling unreconigiesd.
not feeling part of the larger thing, not feeling belogingness. I don&rsquo;t know this is good or bad but it is happening that much I know</li>
<li>also I feel that : do I really invest my energy in content development work or directly work with children but with clear vision and goals.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>In this week I took local khoji&rsquo;s online session</li>
<li>On friday my nanaji got expierd because of long time illness. Me and parents went to mama&rsquo;s place</li>
<li>I wrote blog post called <a href="https://learningwala.in/blog/working-with-youth/">&lsquo;Work with Youth&rsquo;</a></li>

<p>Apart from that I did my first physical session with rameshwari ben children at Vadodara. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I pitched nature education to one CSR through rameshwari ben&rsquo;s NGO but didn&rsquo;t get a positive response. The person was more inclined towards STEM and career oriented intervention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yesterday I met Amit Arora. He runs an NGO called Paper Ball Education. We have discussed how we can collaborate on the nature education front.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I went to see Swara&rsquo;s house. It is a beautiful house. Let&rsquo;s see if everything works out. We will rent out that space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From 15th Pratham work will start. So I am looking forward for that</p>

      <description>WHAT’S BEEN HAPPENING This week was a rollercoaster ride. Nidhi came back from pune. She didn&amp;rsquo;t find any appropriate jobs or house.&#xA;Alternative schools she liked / shortlisted are looking for part time faculties or paying low salary or they are only looking for faculty who can teach academic subjects. She didn&amp;rsquo;t want to get into the NGO sector again doing managerial roles. If I only work in an alternative school called &amp;lsquo;Anubhti&amp;rsquo;, it will be difficult to survive in the city.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="whats-been-happening">WHAT’S BEEN HAPPENING</h2>
<p>This week was a rollercoaster ride. Nidhi came back from pune. She didn&rsquo;t find any appropriate jobs or house.</p>
<p>Alternative schools she liked / shortlisted are looking for part time faculties or paying low salary or they are only looking for faculty who can teach academic subjects. She didn&rsquo;t want to get into the NGO sector again doing managerial roles. If I only work in an alternative school called &lsquo;Anubhti&rsquo;, it will be difficult to survive in the city.  </p>
<p>And alternative schools are only in the cities.</p>
<p>On the other side I got a call from my mother that my father&rsquo;s health is not good and it would be great if I will be there with family.</p>
<p><strong>What to do ?</strong> If someone passionately wants to work with children on a deeper level, alternative schools are the only platform I can see right now and they are not giving much salary. Waldorf schools, krishnamurti schools, democratic schools.. Another option is going to so-called progressive schools or international schools.</p>
<p>Most of the people working in alternative schools already worked in corporate for many years then they started school or started working in the schools. For them it is not their primary income source. For an educator full time doing this work with children for 10 years, there is no financial support system for them. There is no support system of like minded people whcih which most important thing for your growth and mental health.</p>
<p>Either they need to take side projects like consultancy or join the NGO / Development sector as manager roles. Even in NGOs ground workers who actually go and implement the program don&rsquo;t get much salary.</p>
<p><strong>Another way to tackle this thing is</strong>, if you have a partner who can support you. I saw in alternative schools one partner works in corporate and the other works in school.</p>
<p><strong>What about starting your own NGO or company ?</strong> The NGO world is highly dependent on CSR money or grants.</p>
<p>There are too many competitors and there are big players capturing the market. The game is who can do fund raising well. Who can show their work better. Who can scale things. Still there is hope because there are many companies, there is always the possibility to get small small projects every year. But this is a struggle every year.. if you see the larger picture, a 50 years old NGO also struggles to get funding. Instead of working with children, most of your energy goes to find funding</p>
<p><strong>Starting an educational company is the worst idea ever</strong>, a super cluttered market, very difficult to find product market fit. I have never come across company with really good product making money without taking money from CSR</p>
<p><strong>Ok let&rsquo;s come back to the point.</strong> So after a long discussion with Nidhi we have decided that we will not go to Pune.  We asked friends at  Eklavya Foundation if there is any work opportunity. But they are struggling with funding and extension problems so it will take 3 -4 months to materialize anything.</p>
<p><strong>Second option is :</strong> We will go to Vadodara so we can be with family. Now what about work ?</p>
<p>I said no anubhuti people. They are kind and sensitive enough so they understood my situation and supported me.</p>
<p>There is no established alternative school in Vadodara. There are one or two but they are very school and in their early stage. so the same problem. They will get parent volunteers so they will not need full time faculties.</p>
<p><strong>We thought let&rsquo;s start &lsquo;Nature Education&rsquo; work with children.</strong> Exprinatial - Project Based learning : That&rsquo;s what we know. We thought let&rsquo;s start working. For funding we will reach out to friends and family.</p>
<p>We reached out to Akansha, Ravi bhai and Rameshwari ben for funding and many other friends to include them in our initiative as &rsquo;learning partner&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I also applied for a full time job at Pratham as Production Manager of Digital Content. It will be a remote job from Vadodara and once in a month I need to go to Pune. The idea behind it is, if I get it Nidhi will do full time work of Nature Education and we can have one income source in our bag if we don&rsquo;t get funding in future.</p>
<p><strong>Right now</strong> we are waiting for replies from people whom we asked for individual grants.
Also waiting from pratham people to reply about the Job.</p>
<p><strong>The good part is</strong> when I reached out to friends at Vadodara saying I am moving back to vadodara. They were super happy and welcoming. I am really looking forward to the whole thing. It is risky, we don&rsquo;t have any backup, no savings, we need to support our families, at least I don&rsquo;t have any academic qualification and all to go back.. we are at in the ocean.. let&rsquo;s see what will unfold</p>
<h4 id="one-more-good-update-is---vadodra-city-walks">One more good update is - Vadodra City Walks</h4>
<p>we have launched something called &lsquo;Vadodara City Walks&rsquo; with children from Rameshwari ben&rsquo;s NGO.
20 teenage children are exploring water - river in their own city. We had our first orientation on 12th April. We will have our first session with them on 20th April 2024. I am very very excited for this. I had a talk with Siddharth (Veditum) for the same. He is very happy to help and guide me on this journey. I am super happy and greatful. Thank you so much to Jubin for connecting us.</p>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to say about this week. During this whole week Nidhi was not around. She is in Pune to find a job herself and a house for both of us. I was feeling low, anxious, tense the whole week.. we will find a home or not, whether Nidhi will find a job or not, how we will survive in this low salary.. all these questions were running in mind.</description>

we will find a home or not, whether Nidhi will find a job or not, how we will survive in this low salary.. all these questions were running in mind..</p>
<p>My sleep cycle is gone, I am sleeping at 2 - 2.30 at night and waking up by 9 - 10 am.
I have become a mobile addict, not the reels or social media but reading / browsing other stuff.
specifically I have become <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> addict.</p>
<h2 id="whats-been-happening">WHAT’S BEEN HAPPENING</h2>
<h3 id="----website-development">&mdash;&gt; Website Development</h3>
<p><img alt="Terminal" src="/w14/terminal.jpg">
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I spent most of my time this week in developing small small features in my website.
I wanted to escape from the situation so I engaged myself in learning new things and implementing on my website.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have redesigned page called <a href="https://learningwala.in/educational-practice/">&lsquo;Educational Practice&rsquo;</a></li>
<li>updated &lsquo;about us&rsquo; text in all social media (medium, linkedin, instagram)</li>
<li>implemented &lsquo;hugo-bearcub&rsquo; theme with CSS tweak and RSS feed set up</li>
<li>I have shifted all weekly notes in blog section with &lsquo;weekly-notes&rsquo; tag</li>
<li>Custom domain set up with cloudflare SSL certificate</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="--linkedin2md">- Linkedin2MD</h4>
<ul>
<li>I made a copy of my linkedin profile in markdown. I tried using the npm package (<a href="https://github.com/fkztw/linkedin2md">https://github.com/fkztw/linkedin2md</a>) but it didn&rsquo;t work for me so I used inbuilt resume builder of linked in and downloaded PDF and converted it into markdown. I did a little bit (actually a lot time wise) manual editing and adding / copy-pasting specific data from the linkedin profile which was missing in resume builder. Now I have a complete profile on my website which I can update anytime / send it to anyone. I need to put a PDF version of the same.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="--medium-posts-in-markdown">- Medium posts in markdown</h4>
<ul>
<li>Medium changed its policy for readers, that was the one of the triggers to start this website and blog. I have been using Medium for the last 11 years so I wanted to take a backup of my old posts
and put it here in this blog. I checked the medium setting and downloaded all the files but it came in html format which is no use for me directly. I need to convert it into a markdown to put it here. I found and tried one python script and one npm package. The npm package didn&rsquo;t work for me. The Python script worked but it was converting one file at a time. I have lots of files. So I am stuck.
I am searching for another tool or I will try to tweak this script to do multiple files. If anything doesn&rsquo;t work I will do it manually.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="--i-have-learnt-about">- I have learnt about</h4>
<ul>
<li>Github Workflow</li>
<li>How to use github issue as comment box on your website</li>
<li>using Prose.io as CMS</li>
<li>Fediverse</li>
<li>self hosting</li>
</ul>
<p>I will implement these all features in later on, not in priority. you can see what I am work on website <a href="http://simp.ly/p/W6Xjkf">here</a></p>
<h4 id="--custom-domain-email">- Custom domain email</h4>
<ul>
<li>Custom domain email id setup using zoho mail. I have created <a href="mailto:mihir@learningwala.in">mihir@learningwala.in</a> , I was searching for the trick so I can only forward emails written by humans to my new id from my gmail id. I didn&rsquo;t want any subscription / promotion / updates email to come on my new id. Finally I found something called &lsquo;filters&rsquo; in gmail where you can make rules for email forwarding.</li>
</ul>
<p>I use gmail for / at</p>
<ul>
<li>all the places / social accounts / subscription</li>
<li>for using cloud storage G drive (mostly if my collaborator is using it otherwise i mostly use markdown and simplenote for pretty much everything and for project management I use basecamp</li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted my custom domain,it is fun to see and use.  Also I wanted to shift the communication part from gmail to a new custom email id. Where only humans communicate no machine generated emails. Custom domain email on google is costly. Also they only give 30GB cloud storage and if you use a normal paid account you will get 100 gb in 1300 rs yearly.</p>
<p>so I searched for other services which give custom domain email service. Price comparison, feature comparison</p>
<p>Migadu and Fast email came multiple times in the recommendation but finally I signed up for zoho mail. They are giving free custom domain email with 5GB email space. I have tried this service before for some time with my old domain learningwala.com. So I was familiar with it. If only humans talk 5GB is space and if it exceeds the limit/ needs more features the price is 58.34rs per month.</p>
<p>Apart from gmail I was using hey.com / hey email by 37signals (makers of basecamp). It is paid service after a one month trial. But I wrote to them that I really like the service and the price point you are offering (99$ yearly) is not affordable for me. They gave me a 1 year free subscription. I really liked the product and spacilly the desktop and mobile app with clean simple UI and their workflow features. I love writing emails in those apps. But finally I have decided that I need to move on because two reasons :</p>
<ol>
<li>dependence on them for the pricing. I can afford to give 8000 rupees yearly for the email service.</li>
<li>I want to try a custom domain which is more costly then normal email on hey. So finally set an auto responder on hey account saying please email me on my new email id.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="--history-of-my-email-ids-">- History of my email ids :</h4>
<p>I have started with live.com / hotmail / outlook mail</p>
<p>Past :</p>

<li><a href="mailto:mihirism1995@gmail.com">mihirism1995@gmail.com</a> (I was using it till 1.5 year ago, stopped using after my google drive got full)</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="----wix-payment">&mdash;&gt; Wix Payment</h3>
<ul>
<li>I have done mitaliben&rsquo;s school website domain and hosting renewal. It was difficult to do payment on wix because they only accept cards. I got new card from bank in that net banking / international purchase is not active. I tried another friend&rsquo;s card but it didn&rsquo;t work.. finally my axis bank debit card worked. The friend gave the idea that you can activate international purchases from your axis bank app. I quickly downloaded the app, and it worked.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="----call-with-rameshwariben-2nd-april-2024">&mdash;&gt; Call with Rameshwariben (2nd April 2024)</h3>
<ul>
<li>I had a call with Rameshwari ben, she wants to do some activities related to nature / environment with teenage children at her NGO. I did some research and planning for it during the week. I was thinking if we can focus on the river. Visit river, interview, nature journaling, season watch, bird watching, mapping, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have reached out to <a href="https://www.hbcse.tifr.res.in/people/faculty/ankush-gupta">Ankush from HBCSE</a>, <a href="https://yourstory.com/herstory/2022/06/world-environment-day-young-conservationist-plastic-crocodiles-sneha-shahi">Sneha</a>, <a href="https://veditum.org/">Siddharth from Veditum</a>, if they can help us in water testing and other river related activities. Ankush and Sneha replied promptly, they said they can connect me with MSU environment dept and Navrachana university, Sneha will send my requirements to her friends in vadodara so they can help. I also reached out to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/madhushri-mudke-7398b030/?originalSubdomain=in">Madhushree from ATREE</a>, she sent some amazon links to buy water testing kits, Ankush also sent one link for kit.</p>
<h3 id="----writing-about-tools-for-self-directed-learning">&mdash;&gt; Writing about tools for self directed learning</h3>
<p>I have started writing about tools for self-directed learning. What are the tools which can help you in doing self directed learning? I am reflecting on my journey, observation of BeMe children, Conversation with Nidhi and Nidhi Solanki</p>
<p>some of the tools I have identified :</p>
<ul>
<li>Note taking</li>
<li>how to make your portfolio (how to document, your own narrative writing, website or other medium)</li>
<li>how approach people/ communication (cold emails, networking, researching about people - org - project - anything )</li>
<li>how manage your tasks, how to work in team</li>
<li>what is the goal of internship and how to find one</li>
<li>how to prepare yourself for internship</li>
<li>list of places where children can go and work (different location, different subject)</li>
<li>list of mentors</li>
</ul>
<p>Interesting resource - <a href="https://www.recurse.com/self-directives">https://www.recurse.com/self-directives</a></p>
<p>I want to write how you can learn these tools so you can implement them during your sdl journey. I will publish it after I finish writing it.</p>
<h3 id="----seeing-karnataka">&mdash;&gt; Seeing Karnataka</h3>
<p>For the last two semesters in BeMe, I was part of an elective course called <a href="https://howaboutseeingbeng.wixsite.com/seeing-bengaluru">&lsquo;how about seeing bengaluru&rsquo;</a>. Namrata wants to make something similer around karnataka. &lsquo;Seeing Karnataka&rsquo;</p>

      <description>This week was happening. It was an emotional roller coaster ride for me. I was in constant stress about Nidhi&amp;rsquo;s Job and overall decision of moving to pune. We will be able to survive or not. Choosing alternative school to work means low salary, long working hours.. Are we taking the right step? or should we leave our passion and just join a high paying opportunity ? Will we be able to find an affordable house or not.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week was happening. It was an emotional roller coaster ride for me.
I was in constant stress about Nidhi&rsquo;s Job and overall decision of moving to pune. We will be able to survive or not. Choosing alternative school to work means low salary, long working hours.. Are we taking the right step? or should we leave our passion and just join a high paying opportunity ? Will we be able to find an affordable house or not..</p>
<p>On the other side communication - coordination with parents about engagement planning is going on. They are not happy that we are moving to pune without any financial security.</p>
<p>Yesterday Nidhi went to Pune for interviews and visited a few alternative schools. I am praying, hoping something will work out. Over friend Nirmala is getting enage on 12th so we are planning if we can attend the function while coming back from Pune.</p>

</ul>
<p>After I redescoverd about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz">Aaron Swartz</a> recently I was remembering other techies in this ethos. I remembered Anand&rsquo;s website because of its unique name <a href="https://anandology.com/">&lsquo;anandology&rsquo;</a>. I visited his website and surprisingly I found that he worked with Aaron on an infogami, Open library project and he contributed to the Web.py framework.  I immediately emailed him that I want to meet you. He promptly replied and we met.</p>
<p>I was part of a python elective course on python at beme. And I have been exploring scratch since 2013.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 id="developing-my-personal-website">Developing my personal website</h3>
<p>This week I spend lots of time in making - remaking - fixing and adding content to my personal website using hugo server and github pages. I learnt that text editer is importnat part of coding process. first I used sublime text and because of that hugo server was giving some error. I shifted to ubuntu defult text editor and somehow I managed to work. From last few days ubuntu was giving some glitchs on my laptop. specificly about sound and bluetooth. Sound was not coming and bluetooth was not connecting to my boat blootooth speaker. I tried different driver and fixing stuff using ubuntu forums and other websites but no sucess. Finally I re installed ubuntu. Before that I tried using and lots of reading about Manjaro, Pop OS, Fedora.. I installed Pop OS but not satisfied with it, tried Manjaro but I didn&rsquo;t like KDE. Finally I came back to ubuntu 22. During this process of making website I reserched a lot about :</p>
<ul>
<li>static site genrator like hugo, pelican and more</li>
<li>Minimal - indie web blogging platform</li>
<li>Personal wiki and note taking tool</li>
<li>linux distro like manjaro, arch linux</li>
<li>How to use dynamic page and CMS in wix.com</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="linux distro" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EhxznWkXYAAsJch?format=jpg&name=medium"></p>
<p>I know these all are rabbit holes, i spent qite a lot of time to read hackernews this week.</p>
<ul>
<li>But I am happy that I didn&rsquo;t spend much time on instagram or other social media.</li>
<li>I am happy that I learnt to make website using hugo and github pages.  I wanted to use hugo-bearcub theme but it is giving some error. Currently I am using hugo-bearblog theme</li>
<li>making your personal wiki using <a href="http://simplenote.com/">&lsquo;simple note&rsquo;</a></li>
<li>I refreshed my knowldge about git , markdown and basic terminal code</li>
<li>last week I have read few pages from book called <a href="https://public.resource.org/swaraj/">&lsquo;code swaraj&rsquo;</a></li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Aaron " src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Aaron_Swartz_profile.jpg/220px-Aaron_Swartz_profile.jpg"></p>
<p>that lead me to watching <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/">Aaron Swartz&rsquo;s</a>  documetry called &lsquo;Internet&rsquo;s own boy&rsquo;. Yes I know I discovered it very late but I was amazed by watching it. it is very very thought provoking. After watching documentry I spent quite a lot of time reading about open data work of <a href="https://thejeshgn.com/">thejesh GN</a> and other people. <a href="https://www.arvindguptatoys.com/">Arvind Gupta</a> is also doing wonderful work of putting educational / children litreture in public domain through his website and using internet archive.  I was feeling so happy when I got to know that Aaron contributed in making of <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">&lsquo;Markdown&rsquo;</a> and I am using it right now :)</p>
