      <description>It is difficult for me to sit and write reflection of year 2024 because biggest milestone of my life - &amp;lsquo;Marriage&amp;rsquo; is in Feb 2025. Prep for that is going on. Me &amp;amp; Nidhi are also figuring out where to stay after marriage and where to work. Because of my family situation we need to stay near to my hometown Padra - Vadodara. So technically my year is still running.</description>

<p>It is difficult for me to sit and write reflection of year 2024 because biggest milestone of my life - &lsquo;Marriage&rsquo; is in Feb 2025. Prep for that is going on. Me &amp; Nidhi are also figuring out where to stay after marriage and where to work. Because of my family situation we need to stay near to my hometown Padra - Vadodara. So technically my year is still running.. but still I will try to put what ever is coming in the flow.</p>

<p>In Feb 2024 we did <a href="https://public.3.basecamp.com/p/LZQcbKVxaVXu1iZ9SvLeau2F">&lsquo;A matter of time&rsquo;</a> exhibition. It was a culmination of 3 -4 month long journey with Imapana (student from BeMe school). I am very grateful to BeMe for giving me this space to experiment like this. It was long time wish to do this type of work with children. I am planning to write article on pedagogical aspect of this experiment.</p>

<h3 id="moving-back-to-vadodara">Moving back to Vadodara</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Left bangalore and moved to Vadodra : I shifted to BLR on Dec 2022 to join BeMe and spend more time with Nidhi (She was studying in Azim Premji University that time). After finishing MA in education at APU, Nidhi took job at org called ThinkTac - Science education company. She didn&rsquo;t liked the nature of work. It was more working in content development side rather than facilitation / working with children or teacher. She was more interested in facilitation that time. She left the job in 4 months (Jun 2023 - Sep 2023). She took break of 7 months (Oct 2023 - Apr 2024 ) during the break she did small projects like helping me in setting up the time exhibition, book translation for nature classroom, etc.</p>
<p>After one point we both felt that we need to move somewhere else to work. Because joing BeMe was not the option for her that time. If she gets the job somewhere in BLR, everything is very far and expensive. I never wanted to leave BeMe. It was my dream job. But nothing was working out.</p>
<p>We tried shifting to Pune. I got the job at Anubhuti learning center. Similar alternative space like beme. But Nidhi was not getting appropriate job. So we canceled the option.</p>
<p>During that time parents were encouraging me to come back to vadodra, they were feeling lonely, their health were not ok, we wanted to be around them so we can take our marriage conversation forward. So we decided that let&rsquo;s go back to vadodara.</p>
<p>Some how it worked out. I had a talk with Ravi bhai and he offered 1 year grant. I got job as content developer at Pratham Foundation.
Aaakansha also offered 1 year - Escape Velosity Grant to us. So with all of support, we came to Vadodra on 30th April 2024.</p>
<p>Nidhi also got <a href="https://bhoomicollege.org/teach-for-nature-fellowship-fellows">&lsquo;Teach for Nature Fellowship&rsquo;</a> to work in Nature Education in Vadodara.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="engagement---mihir--nidhi">Engagement - Mihir &amp; Nidhi</h3>
<ul>
<li>First thing we did after moving back was event of our formal engagement with friends and family members. It was tough.
10 people coming from Kanpur in train staying in small town like padra, managing whole event, managing everyone&rsquo;s ego - emotions - expectations.. it was tough for me and nidhi both. But we did it. We came out of our comfort zone and did it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Happiest moment was when our friends came to the event and stood with us.</p>

<h3 id="work-at-pratham">Work at Pratham</h3>
<p>Pratham was roller coaster experience. In the beginning I was very happy that I got remote job so I can stay in vadodra and also do other work. Secondly it was content development job in environment domain. My team was producing videos for topics like climate change, plastic literacy and more. There was interesting project called creativity club in our account too. Where we need to develop prompt videos for children age 10+ yrs to foster their creativity, collaboration, communication and problem solving skills.</p>
<p>Overall work was interesting but I could sustain there for more than 7 months.</p>
<p>Few reasons :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It was remote team with large scale, deadline driven project. Working in high peace environment with remote team was new experience for me. I didn&rsquo;t feel connected to team and the factory approach which we were using for content development. I felt very disconnected from ground.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my skills were not very good for this type of work environment. I mostly worked with children or teachers. On ground. Never worked with canva - excel - chatgpt. So it was good learning.</p>
<p>I first time wrote script for videos
I first time made posters &amp; videos on canva
I was part of team of the project at this scale for first time where my content goes to thousands of children pan India.</p>
<p>I learnt how to make content for creativity and other 21st century skills. Mainly we were using design thinking activities, replicating already available activities in our format. But making it useful for large scale project is also good learning.</p>
<p>I learnt about how large scale orgs works, I learnt little bit about partnerships and funding</p>
<p>best part of my work was coordinating with nature educators from all over India to nature education camps with children at different location. It was good that I already had network of people in the domain.</p>
<p>I left pratham on 15th Nov 2024. Took few days back break and joined <a href="https://projectdefy.org/">Project DEFY</a> (25th Nov 2024) as subject matter expert - self directed learning. It&rsquo;s 3 months remote assignment.</p>
<p>during pratham days I first time experienced serious anxiety. Stress. Somehow it was very chill for other team members. But I was not handle constant stress, constant communication &amp; coordination.. it was very bad phase.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="finding-work--expectations-from-home">Finding Work &amp; expectations from home</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Aakansha and Ravi bhai offered the grant for the one year. I left the pratham so now we didn&rsquo;t have any backup for money.
most of the pratham&rsquo;s salary is going to be used in marriage event (all the shopping, jewellery and all). Nidhi has some money coming through fellowship but that also she was not able to continue because multiple things going on at home. so we reached out to all social media, all the friends with the <a href="https://learningwala.in/ourneeds/">request</a>. we got many calls from alternative schools from south, many orgs, individuals.</p>
<p>we are very very grateful to all the people who reached out to us with offerings. People who connected us with other people, people who thought about us.</p>
<p>Because of my family situation we need to stay near to vadodra / ahemdabad. My parents wants us to stay near to them. Because of their loneliness, because of their health, because their insecurities , because they feel socially confident when we are around.. for whatever reasons they are not happy about we leaving vadodra and go far from them.</p>
<p>one more aspect to it is they want Nidhi to be house wife kind of person. Helping my mother to do all the work, not taking independent work. My home is based in Patriarchy system. so to stay far from it we need to find work-stay option where we are not very near to them and not very far.</p>
<p>This year very big chunk of my time went to fight and manage the balance of our values and expectations from family. Friends helped me a lot in this. thank you rameshwari ben, mitali ben, many other friends.</p>
<p>Now we are stuck, we have very limited option at vadodra / ahemdabad for meaningful and well paid work. After eliminating many options right now we left with very few :</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Mitali ben&rsquo;s school :</strong> Ravi bhai is willing to continue grant next year also, Aakansha also offered that if I can help her in some admin work of &rsquo;escape velocity grant&rsquo; she can offer grant for one more year. With this assurance we can move to Mitali ben&rsquo;s school 2hrs far from vadodra and work there. Next year we can again search for grant. (Inlaks Grants, The Circle incubation) Also we can find out some part time / remote work if possible.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Pros :</strong> we can work directly with children, we can develop nature education curriculum / do action reasecrh. Nidhi and me can work on our health, we can also be near to my family. We can also work with other orgs in Vadodra because it is just 2hrs away.</p>
<p><strong>Cons :</strong> Instability of funding, we might feel lonely sometime in village.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Gopaldham learning center :</strong> it is an Ashramshala in Jashdan near rajkot / chotila. 5hrs from vadodra. they are looking for school leader kind of person.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Pros :</strong> there are only 70 children, we will get full freedom to do meaningful work. We both will get work. Good payment also</p>
<p><strong>Cons :</strong> this is new place. We don&rsquo;t know the founders and team personally. No friends, we will feel lonely. We need to leave work we have started in vadodra</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Balgokulam :</strong> it is an early childhood research org based in ahemdabad.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Pro :</strong> good salary. My role will direct working with children and researching about early childhood curriculum. so new learning opportunity. we can come to vadodara when ever is needed, it is just 2hrs</p>
<p><strong>Cons :</strong> new set up don&rsquo;t know what exactly my role looks like. It is new org started in 2023 so don&rsquo;t know the future. We will need to find job for nidhi.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Eklavya, Bhopal :</strong> with Aakansha&rsquo;s funding we can go eklavya bhopal and start working there with libraries. I am not sure that ravi bhai will give funding for that.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Pros :</strong> Eklavya family will be there, lots of new people, friends, projects</p>
<p><strong>Cons :</strong> instability of funding. We need to leave our work which we started in vadodra. We might not get access to children like school. Because we will work with libraries.</p>
<p>I am eliminating BLR right now but we have shortlisted some org if we want to go : creative school, beme, project DEFY, seed to sapling, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="health">Health</h3>
<ul>
<li>Me &amp; Nidhi both went to Nephropathy this year at Nisargupchar Kendra - Gotri, Vadodra. It is wonderful place.
I am suffering from stomach problems and Nidhi is suffering from skin - hair issues. (apart from our mental health) We tried following the diet for month or two.. it was magical.. it works. eating millets and doing yoga. After one point of time it got difficult for us to manage the routine and making food at home. but we want to start it again when we get new place to stay and work. This year I want to start doing regular exercise &amp; eating healthy food. (This very basic and obvious thing but very hard to do )</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="golu">Golu</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nidhi&rsquo;s brother Tanishk aka golu was also there with us in Vadodra for few months. Nidhi invited him to take break after his 12th exam and explore options other than joining privet engineering collage. It was mistake&hellip; we were not ready. it was difficult to make some one self directed learner in short time. Also against his will. It was good learning for us to see what is happening inside us when situation like this come on our face. what happens inside us? , can we empathize ? it was tough time for me personally.</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t find meaning in this type of exploration time, he became phone - game addict, he bought new iphone and it was game changer for him&hellip; in short some mistake from our side, some expectation from his side.. it didn&rsquo;t work out. I was so happy when he went back home. I was genuinely concerned and still I am concerned about his future. I never thought bad about him but our expectation didn&rsquo;t match. We were super busy in our work we really didn&rsquo;t give proper time to him&hellip; it was wrong timing.</p>

<ul>
<li>Our work got recognized : <a href="https://www.early-bird.in/meet-an-educator-mihir-pathak/">ebird - meet the educator article</a> - feeling proud.</li>
<li>I could manage to do local khoji event even with the stress and work load of pratham. I could have done better if I have time. I really didn&rsquo;t get time for the facilitating the project.</li>
<li>We (Nidhi, Mihir, Impana) managed to do &lsquo;A matter of time&rsquo; exhibition. I was on cloud 7 :)</li>
<li>This year I wrote regular <a href="https://learningwala.in/tags/weekly-notes/">weekly notes</a> on my website from week 12 to week 52 = 40 weeks = 10 months. I never thought that I will continue this habit. But I did. I am proud of it.</li>
<li>In first week of Dec I visited BLR to attend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DDd2w5movCJ/?img_index=1">wipro partners</a> (my reflections) forum and meeting children at BeMe. Meeting children from 12+ group was a joy for me.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="BeMe Children " src="/2024/beme.jpeg"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This year was very stressful and I felt serious anxiety many a times. Because of nature of work at Pratha,Home / family issues</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This year I first time tried fund raising. I pitched our work and managed to raised 9L rupees for a year from individual donors. I am very very grateful to them for trusting us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I did session with corporate team for first time. Thank you Mitali ben for co- facilitating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This year I contributed / spent big amount of grant money and pratham&rsquo;s salary money for marriage prep, which I didn&rsquo;t like. I wanted to use that money for children or save it for future. Any way I am happy that we did camp from that money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This year also I am part of Child Development and learning course at Eklavya. I co facilitated sessions this time. After the physical workshop we as team to need to be more active to respond the participant&rsquo;s need. But I felt that other team members are busy with other work and not able to give priority to this. It is frustrating for me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This year we (Nidhi and Mihir) took many workshops and sessions with different age groups. In 2025 we want to take up one project and do deeper work in that. We will take up the project of developing curriculum for Nature Detective program (age 3 to 11yrs) and for older age group we will work with children from sai&rsquo;s angel foundation. We will also plan to do action research kind of thing with Nature Classroom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I took logistic responsibility for the residential camps we did this year. I invited Nidhi, Nishtha and Prerna for facilitation. It was a good experience for me. I learnt about my self that I enjoy doing this type of work also</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea of sangha - tribe - community got stronger in mind this year. I learnt that if you want to walk on this path of alternatives you need strong sangha.. and you need to selflessly contribute in that sangha</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This year tested my and nidhi&rsquo;s bonding.. hard time.. stress.. things we hated came back to us&hellip;but we are strong &amp; together. Thank you so much Nidhi for being you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All these years I was very confused about my offering in education. I am not a subject teacher, I am not a teacher trainer, I don&rsquo;t want to start NGO to scale things.. what exactly I want to do ? This year I got some answers :</p>

<h3 id="what-next-">What next ?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Work front : till 15th March 2025 - Project DEFY&rsquo;s work is there.</li>
<li>Need to figure out work after that. Gopaldham and Balgokulam people will reply in mid Jan. After that we will take a call. I am mostly inclined towards going to mitali ben&rsquo;s school for 1 year and then going back to BLR / stay back if we get regular funding. If we go to mitali ben&rsquo;s school, we will take up curriculum development project for nature detective and also collaborate with nature classroom for action research &amp; material development.</li>
<li>I want to continue work in vadodara. Specially with sai&rsquo;s angel foundation. We (Rameshwari ben , Ashish bhai, Saurabh bhai, Nikita ben, Suraj, Mihir &amp; Nidhi) started one fellowship program for teenager. It&rsquo;s kind of swaraj university model / beme model / self directed learning / relationship model. It was a longest wish to do this type of work with youth. I am looking forward to that.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am prying to universe to give me strength to manage my wedding event peacefully</p>
<p>After writing this much I still feel I missed something..but it&rsquo;s ok. I will update here if I remember something.
let&rsquo;s hope for the best. At this moment I just want to say thank you to Nidhi for always being with me in every situation. Thank you so much to all my friends and extended family.</p>

<li>creative school and other alternative schools in BLR</li>
<li>Moving to Cooore / Joining youcan</li>
</ul>
<p>Current options :</p>
<ul>
<li>Project DEFY and BeMe (Bangalore)</li>
<li>Balgokulam</li>
<li>Vapi home schooling group</li>
<li>getting funds and work at Mitali ben&rsquo;s place</li>
<li>going to bhopal, find out some work at Eklavya</li>
<li>Shishukunj, Bhuj</li>
<li>varun khimani jashdan - gopaldham learning center</li>
</ul>
<p>right now we both are feeling that Bangalore option is great financially and growth wise
but my family (specifically father) wants that we stay in Vadodra and do work here. We are feeling helpless.
we want to be near to our parents but other side there is a financial struggle, we will not get money in Vadodara.
we can definitely do good work if we get funding. let&rsquo;s how it goes.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id="7th-to-14th-sep-2024">7th to 14th Sep 2024</h4>
<p><strong>Saturday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>saturday evening Mitali ben came home and had a talk with Me and Nidhi sapratly
after that we went to padra, had a talk with my parents. Main three things</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>golu should not live here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nidhi should come padra often (once a week) and help mummy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I need to save money / they needed some financial clearity</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>meeting went well.</p>
<p><strong>Sunday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>sunday morning me and Nidhi came to padra, satyed till evening. Evening we (Mihir, Nidhi, Golu) went to SAF (sai&rsquo;s angel foundation)
one girl got accedent there, so nidhi got occupied with that - XRay and other things.. I took session &lsquo;khoji club&rsquo; I have praposed two ideas</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>I will give seed money of 2k, start your own venture</li>
<li>tell me whcih skills you want to learn / what project you want to do</li>
</ol>
<p>most of the children opted for skill thing - cooking, music, art, computer programming, stock market, pet care and more
I am so happy to see children&rsquo;s enthusism. Now we need to find resources for them.</p>
<p>I shifited back to padra.</p>
<p><strong>Monday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nidhi went to Mitali ben&rsquo;s school</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tuesday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>office work. In evening I met <a href="https://ccl.iitgn.ac.in/team/nihar-pandya">Nihar Pandya</a> at Gulmahor</li>
<li>My blood presure got down</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Wednesday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>went to hospital</li>
<li>office work</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Thursday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>office work</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Friday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>went to nidhi&rsquo;d place and worked form there.</li>
<li>it was difficult day for me. First of telling at home that I want to go at Nidhi&rsquo;s place. I was anxious. At nidhi&rsquo;s place it was difficult for me to listen golu&rsquo;s voice. I don&rsquo;t like the rude tone and other thing is whole routine stuff.. I can&rsquo;t see him like this. I shouldn&rsquo;t give this option of gap year.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>what else ?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I randomly did msg to Yogen shah, wrong decision. His is just like I met him for so 10 years ago.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pratham work is going good. Now I am confident about writing script, making poster and editing / making video in canva.
For canva part I still take help of Archi and Neha. They are pro. I need to play more with canva to make it normal for me. Just like I tinker with my website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This sunday khoji club will not happen. I need to go for prayer of one relative. But children are very very excited. They ready with their tasks.
I see big hope to this project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Early bird approached for facilitating birdwalk in Vadodara. I am not sure we will able to do it or not. I will take final call today and email them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am learning to balance my time between work, Nidhi&rsquo;s place and parents place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>on Thursday I saw documentary on swami brahmvedantaji again. This is like 5th or 6th time. This I understood what is &lsquo;self - remembering&rsquo; and what is the technique.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>જે પણ કરો હોંશ થી કરો</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>જે પણ કરો એમાં તમારી હાજરી રહે એવી રીતે કરો</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>જે પણ કરો એમાં પણ રહેવાનું છે અને સાથે સાથે આપણું મૂળ સ્વરૂપ પણ યાદ રાખવાનું છે.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>there is real self without any filters. our ego is making this suffering more difficult.
we need to remember our true self each movement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not too much gyan. It is simple practice.</p>

      <description>31st August to 7th Sep 2024 last saturday was working&#xA;Sunday nidhi went to take a session at vinoba ashram with amit bhai. This time I stayed home. Took some rest.

<li>
<p>last saturday was working</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sunday nidhi went to take a session at vinoba ashram with amit bhai. This time I stayed home. Took some rest.
If I go to a workshop it takes half of my Sunday and it&rsquo;s difficult to get a break on weekdays because of work.
It was difficult for me to decide because Nidhi needs support in session. But we had a chat and she agreed to go alone.
My evening session at sai&rsquo;s angel foundation got canceled because their office got flooded during heavy rains last to last week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monday, Tuesday - hectic days at work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wednesday we went to Nisarag Upchar Kendra (Vinoba Ashram) to take naturopathy treatment for me and nidhi. It was a long due.
We got a new routine and diet. We need to eat Millets, fruits, soups :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thursday, Friday - again busy days at work. Following a new routine is fun + a little difficult. Especially since there are three people at home.
all three need to eat different things. Golu don&rsquo;t like millets and things we eat without masala. So we need to cook for everyone differently.
Nidhi and my diet has some common elements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nidhi is trying to manage new routine and her work (taking sessions with children and planning for the sessions). Right now most of her time is going in to cooking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the rains washing machine got damaged. Repair guy came yesterday and fixed it. It was a panel issue. I didn&rsquo;t give much attention..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>at the parents front : Mitali ben had a talk with my parents and now we need to go to meet them on sunday. I am super anxious about what I will talk about&hellip;
According to mitali ben they are ready for marriage.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>They just want</p>
<ul>
<li>ki me Nidhi ko financial support na karu apne pese bacha ke rakhu :) basically financial security</li>
<li>Nidhi jab bhi mere familiy valo se mile thoda friendly tarike se mile</li>
<li>they are ok ki hum bahar rahe..</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how it goes.</p>
<ul>
<li>This Sunday I have my &lsquo;khoji club&rsquo; session planned.</li>
</ul>
<p>What else ?</p>
<p>I am super frustrated with golu’s behavior. Talking in loud voice
Talking rudely with nidhi, seeing everything from lens of money.
Where I will get more money
Which thing is more costly, I want to grab that because it is costly = good / status
Not getting uncomfortable in anything</p>
<p>He is not following routine at all, all day watching reels or tarak mehta.. All day putting earphones in ears. Waking up like 10 - 11 everyday…</p>
<p>Actually I am ok with routine because, eventually he will get bored and find some activity to learn.
We gave some options like gym, swimming, coaching class for CUET exam, Ankur warikoo’s online course about communication, self learning math and other subjects</p>
<p>He is doing that online course sometimes, and sometimes he does self learning for math. other options are on hold because of rain and willingness
But it is like 2 hrs a day.. All the other time goes on mobile..</p>
<p>I am doubtful that mobile phones will not give the opportunity to get bored.
Let’s see…</p>
<p>Now I am feeling that we should have not called him here and let him do the college he was planning to do. Now it is too late</p>
<p>Few days ago my anger bursted and said something to golu which he didn’t like.
Today I will try to write a sorry email to him.</p>

      <description>17th to 24th August 2024 &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Sunday Nidhi and I took a workshop at Vinoba Ashram on biodiversity. It was in collaboration with Amit bhai (paper ball education and Vinoba ashram). I was stressed because of home stuff and not sure if I can facilitate it or not. I was thinking about not going to the workshop but nidhi was very keen that you need to come. But I sent a msg to Amit bhai saying that I will not co facilitate, I am not in a good state of mind.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id="17th-to-24th-august-2024">17th to 24th August 2024</h4>
<p>&ndash;&gt; Sunday Nidhi and I took a workshop at Vinoba Ashram on biodiversity. It was in collaboration with Amit bhai (paper ball education and Vinoba ashram). I was stressed because of home stuff and not sure if I can facilitate it or not. I was thinking about not going to the workshop but nidhi was very keen that you need to come. But I sent a msg to Amit bhai saying that I will not co facilitate, I am not in a good state of mind.In the morning we went, and when I saw children I couldn’t resist to go on the floor 🙂</p>
<p>Also I wanted to support Nidhi. It went well. It was not a very well planned session but it was the first session and everything was new for Nidhi so she did planning according to her understanding. I gave very less time to planning. Next time we will do more tight planning.</p>
<p>I can see Nidhi growing as a facilitator. She is opening up slowly. She needs to learn how to judge the group and decide the activities.</p>
<p>Working with Amit bhai is a little bit difficult because of his expectations and ideas about the activities. But his intention is good so we will figure it out. We will figure out a way to work together.</p>
<p>Now the next workshop is on 2nd september so we need to work on the same. Topic is - ecosystem and interconnectedness</p>
<p>&ndash;&gt; Monday we were at home only, did home set up the kitchen and other stuff.</p>
<p>Tuesday we went to the office, Nidhi had a meeting with Amit bhai. Reflected on the session.</p>
<p>I did my pratham’s work. Evening we went to a restaurant. Amit bhai shared that Gulmahor will be not available for september so we have decided to work from home only.</p>
<p>&ndash;&gt; Wed, Thu, Fri and Sat - not been to the office. Worked from home only.</p>
<p>&ndash;&gt; Work wise it was a good productive week. I completed most of my tasks.</p>
<p>&ndash;&gt; Whole week I woke around 7.30 to 7.40 (except today. Today I woke up at 8.13) and did stretching, reading for some time. Nidhi also woke up around 8 whole week. She also did stretching. I felt so happy that she did it without being negative. Today we did suryanamaskar together. It was fun.</p>
<p>Nidhi made breakfast - lunch and dinner everyday. It was very good for my stomach and eating together was fun.</p>
<p>&ndash;&gt; We got Jio wifi on thursday. Now I can attend office calls without any limits and yes we can watch tv without any worry about data limit. It is useful and tempting both. We saw lage raho munna bhai and all india rank together (Golu, Nidhi, Mihir)</p>
<p>&ndash;&gt; Working with golu is tough for me. Waking up late, being sleepy and not active in the morning, watching TV or mobile all the time, connecting everything with money - fame - success, not focusing on tasks, being negative in doing physical activity. Eating chilen, not sleeping without AC. I took all the things on my ego. I got stressed about how we will go forward with this mindset.</p>
<p>Yesterday we had a good discussion about the future plan. How to do projects and prepare for the exam. We saw all the courses on the internet but he is not sure what to do. So we decided to do projects and prepare for the common university entrance exam.</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see how everything goes. I am hopeful. I also want to learn how to work with teenagers of this background.</p>
<p>I saw that entrepreneurship is a common subject we like so we will do something about it. Today I gave him a challenge to sit without doing anything for two hours. Let&rsquo;s see he can do it. I will give 1k if I can. I know I should not introduce money in this but I can&rsquo;t help but think that other options are closed right now.</p>
<p>&ndash;&gt; What else ? Other things are ok. Whenever I think about situations at home, I feel stressed so I am engaging myself in other tasks. Not thinking about it. I am looking forward to the session at sai’s angle - saturday club. Yesterday Neha from Moinee foundation called me for curriculum development work, I am looking forward to that also.</p>

<p>spent time in house huntting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>found flat in building where amit bhai is living (narayanvadi). it is fully furnished 2BHK flat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my parents didn&rsquo;t like that Nidhi wants to live in different house</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>on 13th aug we met Rameshwari ben and team at her office. Nidhi will do sessions at CLC and I will do khoji club every Saturday with wizkid children.
I am very very exicted for this opportunity. We can do SDL Projects, internship with children from this platform. I am looking forward..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am also looking forward to ramkrishna mission monthly sessions. Thodi pakki bat karni padegi uske liye. I am also looking forward to Nidhi&rsquo;s work at

I am happy, I am enjoying it. I wrote the first script and Uma appricited it. I am taking it as a learning task. I am learning how to write for video format.
it is interesting, sometimes it feels meaningless when you rewrite according to people&rsquo;s feedbake. write - feedback - rewrite - repeat</p>

bata di us vajhse thoda man halka hua. otherwise it was very very stressful situation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am not feeling setteled while living in this flat, I feel more setteled at gulmahor. sometome time I feel iriteted because of small small things from golu and nidhi

<li>Nidhi worked on session planning</li>
<li>House huntting</li>
</ul>
<p>Sent this email to namrata di and vishal bhai :</p>
<p>આપણે વાત કરવા માટેનો સમય સેટ નથી થઇ રહ્યો એટલે મેં વિચાર્યું કે ઈમેલ જ કરું, શાંતિ થી પોતાના સમયે વાંચી શકાય</p>
<p><strong>અત્યારે શું ચાલી રહ્યું છે :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>મારુ પ્રથમ માં કામ ધીમે ધીમે ચાલી રહ્યું છે. મારે વેસ્ટ મેન્જમેન્ટ, કલામેન્ટ ચેન્જ વિષય પર વિવિધ વિડીયો માટેની સ્ક્રીપ્ટ લખવાની હોય છે. મારો તો સ્ક્રીપ્ટ લખવાનો પહેલો અનુભવ છે એટલે મને થોડી વાર લાગે, બ્રેઈન સ્ટોર્મ કરવા જોઈએ, ક્રિએટિવ કામ છે પણ અહીં આ લોકો એકદમ ફેક્ટરી અપ્રોચ વાપરે છે એટલે મને ખુબ સ્ટ્રેસ થાય.  ટિમ આખી રીમોટ્લી કામ કરે છે, એના ફાયદા છે પણ ગેરફાયદા પણ છે. કોઈ કલ્ચર અથવા કામ સિવાય વાત નહિ.
એક વખત રેઝિગ્નેશન આપવાની કોશિશ કરી પણ ટીમ લિડે કીધું કે તારું કામ બદલી નાખીએ એટલે તને થોડી મજા આવે :) આમ કરી કરી ને ચાલે છે. કેટલીક વાર બધું અર્થ વગરનું લાગે, કોઈક વાર નવું શીખવા મળે છે, મન ઉપર કામ થઇ રહ્યું છે..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>નિધિ અહીં પાછી આવી ગઈ છે. એની ફેલોશીપ નું કામ શરૂ કરશે, અમિત ભાઈ અને બીજા એક બે મિત્રો બાળકો શોધવા માં મદદ કરી રહ્યા છે. અત્યારે 3 લર્નિંગ સેન્ટર ઉપર બાળકો સાથે નેચર એજ્યુકેશન પર કામ થશે એવું ગોઠવ્યું છે.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>હું અહીં રામેશ્વરી બેન ની સંસ્થાના બાળકો સાથે થોડો સમય વિતાવું છું. લોકલ ખોજી કરીને &lsquo;લોકલ સિવિક પ્રોબ્લેમ સોલવિંગઃ&rsquo; ઉપર એક કોર્સ લીધો. આ ગ્રુપ આપણા 12+ ના ગ્રુપ જેવું જ છે. એમની સાથે નાના નાના પ્રોજેક્ટ કરું છું.
એ લોકો માટે ઇન્ટર્નશિપ ડિઝાઇન કરી રહ્યા છે. હું વિચારતો હતો કે બીમી ના બાળકો પણ અહીં ઇન્ટર્નશિપ કરવા માટે આવી શકે.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ઈમ્પના અને સાત્વિકા સાથે અઠવાડિયા માં એક વખત વાત થઇ જાય છે. પોડકાસ્ટ વાળા પ્રોજેક્ટ પાછો શરૂ કરવાનો છે. કોશિશ કરી રહ્યા છે.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ઘરે શું ચાલી રહ્યું છે :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ઘણી વાર મને લાગે કે અમે વડોદરા આવવાનો નિર્ણય ખોટો લઇ લીધો. એ વખતે નિધિ ને થિન્ક ટેક માં ન ફાવ્યું, એ બીમી માં સેટ થશે કે નહિ એ મને ડાઉટ હતો, ઘરે મમ્મી ને અને પપ્પા ની તબિયત સારી નહોતી રહેતી, સગાઈ માટે પણ અમે લોકો અહીં એમની સામે હતા તે સારું રહ્યું , જો અહીં રહેવા ન આવ્યા હોત તો સગાઈ માટે અઘરું પડત. આ બધું જોતા વડોદરા આવવાનો નિર્ણય બરાબર લાગે છે. પણ બીમી ને ખુબ મિસ કરું છું હું. મને ઘણા વર્ષો પછી મારે જેવું કામ કરવું હતું એના માટેનું પ્લેટફોર્મ મળ્યું હતું, પણ હું ચાહતો હોવા છતાં કામ ન કરી શક્યો.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>નિધિ હમણાં લગ્ન ન થાય ત્યાં સુધી અલગ ઘર માં રહેવાની છે. એના ઘરે થી સાથે રહેવાની પરમિશન નથી, મારા ઘરે એવો કઈ વાંધો નથી પણ&hellip; + એનો નાના ભાઈએ 12 પછી એક વર્ષનો બ્રેક લીધો છે, એટલે એ પણ રહેવા આવવા માંગે છે એટલે એવું સેટ કર્યું છે હમણાં. ઘર શોધી રહ્યા છે.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ઘરે એક દિવસ મેં નિધિ સાથે વાસણ ઘસ્યા એમાં મમ્મી - પપ્પા ને બહુ ખરાબ લાગ્યું. એમને એવું થયું કે નિધિ મારી પાસે કામ કરાવે છે. મેં કીધું કે અમે બંને મળીને કામ કરી રહ્યા છે. પણ એ ન માન્યા, નિધિ કઈ મને ફોર્સ કરીને નહોતી બોલાવતી. બીજી રીતે પણ એ લોકો એવી એક્સપેક્ટેશન રાખે કે નિધિ જોબ ના કરે બસ ઘરનું કામ કરે.. પપ્પા ને તો  હજી આ સંબંધ ગમતો જ નથી, પૈસાની બાબતે પણ એમને એવું થાય.. નિધિ ની જોબ નહોતી ત્યારે મેં નિધિ ને મેં થોડી મદદ કરી હતી એમાં એમને વાંધો પડી ગયો.. કેમ એને પૈસા આપ્યા.. આ છોકરી બધા પૈસા પડાવી લેશે ને આવું બધું.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>મને બહુ જ ગુસ્સો આવે, પણ કોને કહું કેવી રીતે આમાં આગળ વધુ ખબર નથી પડતી, મને લાગતું હતું મમ્મી સમજશે, એ પણ આવી જ બધી વાતો કરે છે. તો હમણાં આ બધી વાતનો સ્ટ્રેસ ચાલે છે.</p>
<p>ચાલો હમણાં આટલી અપડેટ રાખીએ, પછી પાછા વધારે વાત કરીશું</p>
<p>આવજો</p>

      <description>From 1st June to 8th June Mostly did office (Pratham&amp;rsquo;s) work. Had a call with my team lead. Had meetings with the team for a new content development project. I am not enjoying work at Pratham fully because of sevral reasons. Pratham is a big org. Culture of the org feels more corporate (I worked at eklavya and BeMe. Nobody can bit that culture) work of developing content sometimes feels meaningless and espacially when you are working on some CSR project whcih is demanding a specific kind of content which is not alligned with your thought process.</description>

<li>Pratham is a big org. Culture of the org feels more corporate (I worked at eklavya and BeMe. Nobody can bit that culture)</li>
<li>work of developing content sometimes feels meaningless and espacially when you are working on some CSR project whcih is demanding a specific kind of content which is not alligned with your thought process.</li>
<li>Sometimes I am technically not skilled enough to develop content using AI tools. Young people in my team use AI like a pro. I sometimes run out of learning new skills and hold on to what I already know.</li>
<li>I mostly worked in small teams. Worked directly with the founder or team leads. where people know my skills and they value it. Give recongtion. Here I am one of hundrads. so I am feeling unreconigiesd.
not feeling part of the larger thing, not feeling belogingness. I don&rsquo;t know this is good or bad but it is happening that much I know</li>
<li>also I feel that : do I really invest my energy in content development work or directly work with children but with clear vision and goals.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>In this week I took local khoji&rsquo;s online session</li>
<li>On friday my nanaji got expierd because of long time illness. Me and parents went to mama&rsquo;s place</li>
<li>I wrote blog post called <a href="https://learningwala.in/blog/working-with-youth/">&lsquo;Work with Youth&rsquo;</a></li>

<p>Whole week went in an engagement thing. It was a complex project beyond my expectation. event management + people&rsquo;s ego management and what not..But I somehow finished it. I want to put photographs here but cropping and uploading is a little difficult when you are updating a website / blog from a local machine. I will put it on instagram.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apart from that I did my first physical session with rameshwari ben children at Vadodara. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I pitched nature education to one CSR through rameshwari ben&rsquo;s NGO but didn&rsquo;t get a positive response. The person was more inclined towards STEM and career oriented intervention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yesterday I met Amit Arora. He runs an NGO called Paper Ball Education. We have discussed how we can collaborate on the nature education front.</p>

      <description>WHAT’S BEEN HAPPENING This week was a rollercoaster ride. Nidhi came back from pune. She didn&amp;rsquo;t find any appropriate jobs or house.&#xA;Alternative schools she liked / shortlisted are looking for part time faculties or paying low salary or they are only looking for faculty who can teach academic subjects. She didn&amp;rsquo;t want to get into the NGO sector again doing managerial roles. If I only work in an alternative school called &amp;lsquo;Anubhti&amp;rsquo;, it will be difficult to survive in the city.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="whats-been-happening">WHAT’S BEEN HAPPENING</h2>
<p>This week was a rollercoaster ride. Nidhi came back from pune. She didn&rsquo;t find any appropriate jobs or house.</p>
<p>Alternative schools she liked / shortlisted are looking for part time faculties or paying low salary or they are only looking for faculty who can teach academic subjects. She didn&rsquo;t want to get into the NGO sector again doing managerial roles. If I only work in an alternative school called &lsquo;Anubhti&rsquo;, it will be difficult to survive in the city.  </p>
<p>And alternative schools are only in the cities.</p>
<p>On the other side I got a call from my mother that my father&rsquo;s health is not good and it would be great if I will be there with family.</p>
<p><strong>What to do ?</strong> If someone passionately wants to work with children on a deeper level, alternative schools are the only platform I can see right now and they are not giving much salary. Waldorf schools, krishnamurti schools, democratic schools.. Another option is going to so-called progressive schools or international schools.</p>
<p>Most of the people working in alternative schools already worked in corporate for many years then they started school or started working in the schools. For them it is not their primary income source. For an educator full time doing this work with children for 10 years, there is no financial support system for them. There is no support system of like minded people whcih which most important thing for your growth and mental health.</p>
<p>Either they need to take side projects like consultancy or join the NGO / Development sector as manager roles. Even in NGOs ground workers who actually go and implement the program don&rsquo;t get much salary.</p>
<p><strong>Another way to tackle this thing is</strong>, if you have a partner who can support you. I saw in alternative schools one partner works in corporate and the other works in school.</p>
<p><strong>What about starting your own NGO or company ?</strong> The NGO world is highly dependent on CSR money or grants.</p>
<p>There are too many competitors and there are big players capturing the market. The game is who can do fund raising well. Who can show their work better. Who can scale things. Still there is hope because there are many companies, there is always the possibility to get small small projects every year. But this is a struggle every year.. if you see the larger picture, a 50 years old NGO also struggles to get funding. Instead of working with children, most of your energy goes to find funding</p>
<p><strong>Starting an educational company is the worst idea ever</strong>, a super cluttered market, very difficult to find product market fit. I have never come across company with really good product making money without taking money from CSR</p>
<p><strong>Ok let&rsquo;s come back to the point.</strong> So after a long discussion with Nidhi we have decided that we will not go to Pune.  We asked friends at  Eklavya Foundation if there is any work opportunity. But they are struggling with funding and extension problems so it will take 3 -4 months to materialize anything.</p>
<p><strong>Second option is :</strong> We will go to Vadodara so we can be with family. Now what about work ?</p>
<p>I said no anubhuti people. They are kind and sensitive enough so they understood my situation and supported me.</p>
<p>There is no established alternative school in Vadodara. There are one or two but they are very school and in their early stage. so the same problem. They will get parent volunteers so they will not need full time faculties.</p>
<p><strong>We thought let&rsquo;s start &lsquo;Nature Education&rsquo; work with children.</strong> Exprinatial - Project Based learning : That&rsquo;s what we know. We thought let&rsquo;s start working. For funding we will reach out to friends and family.</p>
<p>We reached out to Akansha, Ravi bhai and Rameshwari ben for funding and many other friends to include them in our initiative as &rsquo;learning partner&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I also applied for a full time job at Pratham as Production Manager of Digital Content. It will be a remote job from Vadodara and once in a month I need to go to Pune. The idea behind it is, if I get it Nidhi will do full time work of Nature Education and we can have one income source in our bag if we don&rsquo;t get funding in future.</p>
<p><strong>Right now</strong> we are waiting for replies from people whom we asked for individual grants.
Also waiting from pratham people to reply about the Job.</p>
<p><strong>The good part is</strong> when I reached out to friends at Vadodara saying I am moving back to vadodara. They were super happy and welcoming. I am really looking forward to the whole thing. It is risky, we don&rsquo;t have any backup, no savings, we need to support our families, at least I don&rsquo;t have any academic qualification and all to go back.. we are at in the ocean.. let&rsquo;s see what will unfold</p>
<h4 id="one-more-good-update-is---vadodra-city-walks">One more good update is - Vadodra City Walks</h4>
<p>we have launched something called &lsquo;Vadodara City Walks&rsquo; with children from Rameshwari ben&rsquo;s NGO.
20 teenage children are exploring water - river in their own city. We had our first orientation on 12th April. We will have our first session with them on 20th April 2024. I am very very excited for this. I had a talk with Siddharth (Veditum) for the same. He is very happy to help and guide me on this journey. I am super happy and greatful. Thank you so much to Jubin for connecting us.</p>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to say about this week. During this whole week Nidhi was not around. She is in Pune to find a job herself and a house for both of us. I was feeling low, anxious, tense the whole week.. we will find a home or not, whether Nidhi will find a job or not, how we will survive in this low salary.. all these questions were running in mind.</description>

we will find a home or not, whether Nidhi will find a job or not, how we will survive in this low salary.. all these questions were running in mind..</p>
<p>My sleep cycle is gone, I am sleeping at 2 - 2.30 at night and waking up by 9 - 10 am.
I have become a mobile addict, not the reels or social media but reading / browsing other stuff.
specifically I have become <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> addict.</p>
<h2 id="whats-been-happening">WHAT’S BEEN HAPPENING</h2>
<h3 id="----website-development">&mdash;&gt; Website Development</h3>
<p><img alt="Terminal" src="/w14/terminal.jpg">
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I spent most of my time this week in developing small small features in my website.
I wanted to escape from the situation so I engaged myself in learning new things and implementing on my website.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have redesigned page called <a href="https://learningwala.in/educational-practice/">&lsquo;Educational Practice&rsquo;</a></li>
<li>updated &lsquo;about us&rsquo; text in all social media (medium, linkedin, instagram)</li>
<li>implemented &lsquo;hugo-bearcub&rsquo; theme with CSS tweak and RSS feed set up</li>
<li>I have shifted all weekly notes in blog section with &lsquo;weekly-notes&rsquo; tag</li>
<li>Custom domain set up with cloudflare SSL certificate</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="--linkedin2md">- Linkedin2MD</h4>
<ul>
<li>I made a copy of my linkedin profile in markdown. I tried using the npm package (<a href="https://github.com/fkztw/linkedin2md">https://github.com/fkztw/linkedin2md</a>) but it didn&rsquo;t work for me so I used inbuilt resume builder of linked in and downloaded PDF and converted it into markdown. I did a little bit (actually a lot time wise) manual editing and adding / copy-pasting specific data from the linkedin profile which was missing in resume builder. Now I have a complete profile on my website which I can update anytime / send it to anyone. I need to put a PDF version of the same.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="--medium-posts-in-markdown">- Medium posts in markdown</h4>
<ul>
<li>Medium changed its policy for readers, that was the one of the triggers to start this website and blog. I have been using Medium for the last 11 years so I wanted to take a backup of my old posts
and put it here in this blog. I checked the medium setting and downloaded all the files but it came in html format which is no use for me directly. I need to convert it into a markdown to put it here. I found and tried one python script and one npm package. The npm package didn&rsquo;t work for me. The Python script worked but it was converting one file at a time. I have lots of files. So I am stuck.
I am searching for another tool or I will try to tweak this script to do multiple files. If anything doesn&rsquo;t work I will do it manually.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="--i-have-learnt-about">- I have learnt about</h4>
<ul>
<li>Github Workflow</li>
<li>How to use github issue as comment box on your website</li>
<li>using Prose.io as CMS</li>
<li>Fediverse</li>
<li>self hosting</li>
</ul>
<p>I will implement these all features in later on, not in priority. you can see what I am work on website <a href="http://simp.ly/p/W6Xjkf">here</a></p>
<h4 id="--custom-domain-email">- Custom domain email</h4>
<ul>
<li>Custom domain email id setup using zoho mail. I have created <a href="mailto:mihir@learningwala.in">mihir@learningwala.in</a> , I was searching for the trick so I can only forward emails written by humans to my new id from my gmail id. I didn&rsquo;t want any subscription / promotion / updates email to come on my new id. Finally I found something called &lsquo;filters&rsquo; in gmail where you can make rules for email forwarding.</li>
</ul>
<p>I use gmail for / at</p>
<ul>
<li>all the places / social accounts / subscription</li>
<li>for using cloud storage G drive (mostly if my collaborator is using it otherwise i mostly use markdown and simplenote for pretty much everything and for project management I use basecamp</li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted my custom domain,it is fun to see and use.  Also I wanted to shift the communication part from gmail to a new custom email id. Where only humans communicate no machine generated emails. Custom domain email on google is costly. Also they only give 30GB cloud storage and if you use a normal paid account you will get 100 gb in 1300 rs yearly.</p>
<p>so I searched for other services which give custom domain email service. Price comparison, feature comparison</p>
<p>Migadu and Fast email came multiple times in the recommendation but finally I signed up for zoho mail. They are giving free custom domain email with 5GB email space. I have tried this service before for some time with my old domain learningwala.com. So I was familiar with it. If only humans talk 5GB is space and if it exceeds the limit/ needs more features the price is 58.34rs per month.</p>
<p>Apart from gmail I was using hey.com / hey email by 37signals (makers of basecamp). It is paid service after a one month trial. But I wrote to them that I really like the service and the price point you are offering (99$ yearly) is not affordable for me. They gave me a 1 year free subscription. I really liked the product and spacilly the desktop and mobile app with clean simple UI and their workflow features. I love writing emails in those apps. But finally I have decided that I need to move on because two reasons :</p>
<ol>
<li>dependence on them for the pricing. I can afford to give 8000 rupees yearly for the email service.</li>
<li>I want to try a custom domain which is more costly then normal email on hey. So finally set an auto responder on hey account saying please email me on my new email id.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="--history-of-my-email-ids-">- History of my email ids :</h4>
<p>I have started with live.com / hotmail / outlook mail</p>
<p>Past :</p>

<h3 id="----wix-payment">&mdash;&gt; Wix Payment</h3>
<ul>
<li>I have done mitaliben&rsquo;s school website domain and hosting renewal. It was difficult to do payment on wix because they only accept cards. I got new card from bank in that net banking / international purchase is not active. I tried another friend&rsquo;s card but it didn&rsquo;t work.. finally my axis bank debit card worked. The friend gave the idea that you can activate international purchases from your axis bank app. I quickly downloaded the app, and it worked.</li>

<h3 id="----call-with-rameshwariben-2nd-april-2024">&mdash;&gt; Call with Rameshwariben (2nd April 2024)</h3>
<ul>
<li>I had a call with Rameshwari ben, she wants to do some activities related to nature / environment with teenage children at her NGO. I did some research and planning for it during the week. I was thinking if we can focus on the river. Visit river, interview, nature journaling, season watch, bird watching, mapping, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have reached out to <a href="https://www.hbcse.tifr.res.in/people/faculty/ankush-gupta">Ankush from HBCSE</a>, <a href="https://yourstory.com/herstory/2022/06/world-environment-day-young-conservationist-plastic-crocodiles-sneha-shahi">Sneha</a>, <a href="https://veditum.org/">Siddharth from Veditum</a>, if they can help us in water testing and other river related activities. Ankush and Sneha replied promptly, they said they can connect me with MSU environment dept and Navrachana university, Sneha will send my requirements to her friends in vadodara so they can help. I also reached out to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/madhushri-mudke-7398b030/?originalSubdomain=in">Madhushree from ATREE</a>, she sent some amazon links to buy water testing kits, Ankush also sent one link for kit.</p>
<h3 id="----writing-about-tools-for-self-directed-learning">&mdash;&gt; Writing about tools for self directed learning</h3>
<p>I have started writing about tools for self-directed learning. What are the tools which can help you in doing self directed learning? I am reflecting on my journey, observation of BeMe children, Conversation with Nidhi and Nidhi Solanki</p>
<p>some of the tools I have identified :</p>
<ul>
<li>Note taking</li>
<li>how to make your portfolio (how to document, your own narrative writing, website or other medium)</li>
<li>how approach people/ communication (cold emails, networking, researching about people - org - project - anything )</li>
<li>how manage your tasks, how to work in team</li>
<li>what is the goal of internship and how to find one</li>
<li>how to prepare yourself for internship</li>
<li>list of places where children can go and work (different location, different subject)</li>
<li>list of mentors</li>
</ul>
<p>Interesting resource - <a href="https://www.recurse.com/self-directives">https://www.recurse.com/self-directives</a></p>
<p>I want to write how you can learn these tools so you can implement them during your sdl journey. I will publish it after I finish writing it.</p>

      <description>This week was happening. It was an emotional roller coaster ride for me. I was in constant stress about Nidhi&amp;rsquo;s Job and overall decision of moving to pune. We will be able to survive or not. Choosing alternative school to work means low salary, long working hours.. Are we taking the right step? or should we leave our passion and just join a high paying opportunity ? Will we be able to find an affordable house or not.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week was happening. It was an emotional roller coaster ride for me.
I was in constant stress about Nidhi&rsquo;s Job and overall decision of moving to pune. We will be able to survive or not. Choosing alternative school to work means low salary, long working hours.. Are we taking the right step? or should we leave our passion and just join a high paying opportunity ? Will we be able to find an affordable house or not..</p>
<p>On the other side communication - coordination with parents about engagement planning is going on. They are not happy that we are moving to pune without any financial security.</p>
<p>Yesterday Nidhi went to Pune for interviews and visited a few alternative schools. I am praying, hoping something will work out. Over friend Nirmala is getting enage on 12th so we are planning if we can attend the function while coming back from Pune.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 id="developing-my-personal-website">Developing my personal website</h3>
<p>This week I spend lots of time in making - remaking - fixing and adding content to my personal website using hugo server and github pages. I learnt that text editer is importnat part of coding process. first I used sublime text and because of that hugo server was giving some error. I shifted to ubuntu defult text editor and somehow I managed to work. From last few days ubuntu was giving some glitchs on my laptop. specificly about sound and bluetooth. Sound was not coming and bluetooth was not connecting to my boat blootooth speaker. I tried different driver and fixing stuff using ubuntu forums and other websites but no sucess. Finally I re installed ubuntu. Before that I tried using and lots of reading about Manjaro, Pop OS, Fedora.. I installed Pop OS but not satisfied with it, tried Manjaro but I didn&rsquo;t like KDE. Finally I came back to ubuntu 22. During this process of making website I reserched a lot about :</p>
<ul>
<li>static site genrator like hugo, pelican and more</li>
<li>Minimal - indie web blogging platform</li>
<li>Personal wiki and note taking tool</li>
<li>linux distro like manjaro, arch linux</li>
<li>How to use dynamic page and CMS in wix.com</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="linux distro" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EhxznWkXYAAsJch?format=jpg&name=medium"></p>
<p>I know these all are rabbit holes, i spent qite a lot of time to read hackernews this week.</p>
<ul>
<li>But I am happy that I didn&rsquo;t spend much time on instagram or other social media.</li>
<li>I am happy that I learnt to make website using hugo and github pages.  I wanted to use hugo-bearcub theme but it is giving some error. Currently I am using hugo-bearblog theme</li>
<li>making your personal wiki using <a href="http://simplenote.com/">&lsquo;simple note&rsquo;</a></li>
<li>I refreshed my knowldge about git , markdown and basic terminal code</li>
<li>last week I have read few pages from book called <a href="https://public.resource.org/swaraj/">&lsquo;code swaraj&rsquo;</a></li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Aaron " src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Aaron_Swartz_profile.jpg/220px-Aaron_Swartz_profile.jpg"></p>
<p>that lead me to watching <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/">Aaron Swartz&rsquo;s</a>  documetry called &lsquo;Internet&rsquo;s own boy&rsquo;. Yes I know I discovered it very late but I was amazed by watching it. it is very very thought provoking. After watching documentry I spent quite a lot of time reading about open data work of <a href="https://thejeshgn.com/">thejesh GN</a> and other people. <a href="https://www.arvindguptatoys.com/">Arvind Gupta</a> is also doing wonderful work of putting educational / children litreture in public domain through his website and using internet archive.  I was feeling so happy when I got to know that Aaron contributed in making of <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">&lsquo;Markdown&rsquo;</a> and I am using it right now :)</p>
