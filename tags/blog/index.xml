      <title>Biology of Money</title>

      <description>Summary of Today’s Session We are not very different from other species. Fungi do trading, we do too. Animals hunt and gather, and so do we. Animals signal for mating and choose the best partner to carry their genes forward. We do that too. Animals compete, and we do the same. Our body and brain perceive only a small part of reality, just like the example of a Herring Gull bird focusing on a red dot.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="summary-of-todays-session">Summary of Today’s Session</h2>
<h3 id="we-are-not-very-different-from-other-species">We are not very different from other species.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fungi do trading, we do too.</li>
<li>Animals hunt and gather, and so do we.</li>
<li>Animals signal for mating and choose the best partner to carry their genes forward. We do that too.</li>
<li>Animals compete, and we do the same.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our body and brain perceive only a small part of reality, just like the example of a Herring Gull bird focusing on a red dot. We too often see just the &ldquo;red dot&rdquo; in many situations. This is why:</p>
<ul>
<li>We watch Bollywood movies (which mostly contain violence and romance).</li>
<li>We eat junk food (caught in the dopamine loop).</li>
<li>We get alarmed when politicians say another community will destroy our existence – we get triggered.</li>
<li>We know we can make healthy food at home, but we still order from outside.</li>
<li>We get influenced by &ldquo;artificial needs,&rdquo; like the idea that we need to buy certain brands to look cool. These aren’t real needs; they’re socially constructed to benefit companies.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-can-we-do-about-this">What can we do about this?</h3>
<p>Signals from our DNA aren’t always good for us. Take surgery, for example. When you undergo surgery, your brain signals pain because it perceives it as a threat. But we use anesthesia to stop the pain and perform surgery for a better future.</p>
<p>Similarly, sometimes we need to ignore signals from our genes and think:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do I really need this?</li>
<li>Do I really need to compete?</li>
<li>Is there really a scarcity, or do we have enough?</li>
<li>Should I accept everything that comes from the past or tradition without questioning it?</li>
</ul>
<p>Our DNA might tell us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy more</li>
<li>Fight because they’re &ldquo;destroying&rdquo; us</li>
<li>Earn more because we’re not safe</li>
</ul>
<p>But we need to ask: Really?</p>
<h3 id="our-nature-can-also-help-us-grow">Our Nature Can Also Help Us Grow</h3>
<p>For example, curiosity, learning, and creation are part of our nature. So, let’s use that to create things that solve real-world problems. This will give us both money and fulfillment.</p>
<h2 id="money">Money</h2>
<p>Money isn’t inherently bad. It’s a system, a mutually agreed-upon concept made by humans to run society. However, like any complex system, it has its flaws.</p>
<h3 id="why-are-money-status-and-people-connected">Why are Money, Status, and People Connected?</h3>
<p>Biologically, having more resources means more safety and freedom. Since money provides resources, people tend to respect and give status to those who have it. But this is like focusing only on the red dot – we shouldn’t judge people or choices based solely on money. There are many other factors to consider.</p>
<p>Whether you’re choosing a partner or a career, looking only at money, fame, or status might lead to a downfall. So, think about other aspects too.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="we-give-irrational-value-to-many-things-and-chase-after-them">We Give Irrational Value to Many Things and Chase After Them</h2>
<p>We place irrational value on luxurious bikes, cars, watches, phones, and houses. They become status symbols, and people work hard just to achieve these symbols. This is completely irrational.</p>
<p>But we can change our status symbols. Imagine if these were society’s new status symbols:</p>
<h3 id="signs-of-a-healthy-wealthy-and-wise-society">Signs of a Healthy, Wealthy, and Wise Society</h3>
<p><em>(Shared by Manish Jain, inspired by Bhutan’s GNH)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Walking and bicycling are the primary modes of transport.</li>
<li>Animals of all shapes and sizes (at least 10 different species) can walk freely in neighborhoods, feeling safe and respected.</li>
<li>Every neighborhood has at least 100 diverse plant and tree species, including organic fruits, wild foods, and medicinal plants, and the soil is rich with microorganisms.</li>
<li>People spend at least one hour a day drinking herbal tea with friends.</li>
<li>Fresh bread is made and eaten daily using freshly ground flour, often two to three times per day.</li>
<li>Men feel comfortable crying in front of others and are encouraged to share their feelings openly. Daily human touch is encouraged.</li>
<li>There’s no need for excessive security measures like CCTV, security guards, barbed wire fencing, or high military spending. People don’t have to lock their doors.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-are-your-indicators-of-happiness">What Are Your Indicators of Happiness?</h3>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-makes-a-good-society">What Makes a Good Society?</h2>
<p>A good society is where everyone feels respected and has the opportunity to grow.</p>
<p>Today, on Republic Day, let’s take a pause…</p>
<p>The five basic constitutional values of India, as outlined in the Preamble of the Indian Constitution, are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Justice</strong> – Social, economic, and political justice for all citizens, ensuring fairness and equality in society.</li>
<li><strong>Liberty</strong> – Freedom of thought, expression, belief, faith, and worship, protecting individual rights and personal freedoms.</li>
<li><strong>Equality</strong> – Equal status and opportunity for all, ensuring that everyone is treated without discrimination based on religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth.</li>
<li><strong>Fraternity</strong> – Promoting a sense of brotherhood and unity among citizens, ensuring dignity for the individual and the unity and integrity of the nation.</li>
<li><strong>Secularism</strong> – Ensuring that the state treats all religions equally and does not promote or favor any particular religion.</li>
</ol>
<p>These values form the foundation of India&rsquo;s democratic and inclusive system, ensuring the rights and freedoms of its citizens.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="assignment-for-everyone">Assignment for Everyone</h2>
<p>Think about these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is there such a difference in the salaries of a farmer and a software engineer? Both work hard, right?</li>
<li>What would happen if we gave the same salary to every profession?</li>
</ul>
<p>Write a short note about these two questions and share it with us within the next 10 days.</p>
<p>Feel free to reach out to us if you want to discuss anything.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

      <description>It is difficult for me to sit and write reflection of year 2024 because biggest milestone of my life - &amp;lsquo;Marriage&amp;rsquo; is in Feb 2025. Prep for that is going on. Me &amp;amp; Nidhi are also figuring out where to stay after marriage and where to work. Because of my family situation we need to stay near to my hometown Padra - Vadodara. So technically my year is still running.</description>

<p>It is difficult for me to sit and write reflection of year 2024 because biggest milestone of my life - &lsquo;Marriage&rsquo; is in Feb 2025. Prep for that is going on. Me &amp; Nidhi are also figuring out where to stay after marriage and where to work. Because of my family situation we need to stay near to my hometown Padra - Vadodara. So technically my year is still running.. but still I will try to put what ever is coming in the flow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Feb 2024 we did <a href="https://public.3.basecamp.com/p/LZQcbKVxaVXu1iZ9SvLeau2F">&lsquo;A matter of time&rsquo;</a> exhibition. It was a culmination of 3 -4 month long journey with Imapana (student from BeMe school). I am very grateful to BeMe for giving me this space to experiment like this. It was long time wish to do this type of work with children. I am planning to write article on pedagogical aspect of this experiment.</p>

<p>In Feb I have visited Chennai beach to see turtle nesting with Harshit (student from BeMe). <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C30Qx76tfhv/?img_index=1">It was very new experience for me</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I met many inspiring &amp; intersting people this year - <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C21GbryIQ97/?img_index=1">Jane Sahi</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C30Qx76tfhv/?img_index=1">Arun V</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C51RvfvoGYh/?img_index=1">Anand Chitipothu</a>, <a href="https://invertedpassion.com/">Paras Chopra</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wowsig/?hl=en">Aakansha Gaur</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C59-MIZIeKj/">Nature Classroom team</a> , <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C14ocvOIbaO/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">ATREE Water workshop</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C2gbwwFItFS/?img_index=1">Sci Gallary BLR taeam</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C6Dvv9yoMh1/">Anish &amp; Junuka</a></p>

<h3 id="moving-back-to-vadodara">Moving back to Vadodara</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Left bangalore and moved to Vadodra : I shifted to BLR on Dec 2022 to join BeMe and spend more time with Nidhi (She was studying in Azim Premji University that time). After finishing MA in education at APU, Nidhi took job at org called ThinkTac - Science education company. She didn&rsquo;t liked the nature of work. It was more working in content development side rather than facilitation / working with children or teacher. She was more interested in facilitation that time. She left the job in 4 months (Jun 2023 - Sep 2023). She took break of 7 months (Oct 2023 - Apr 2024 ) during the break she did small projects like helping me in setting up the time exhibition, book translation for nature classroom, etc.</p>
<p>After one point we both felt that we need to move somewhere else to work. Because joing BeMe was not the option for her that time. If she gets the job somewhere in BLR, everything is very far and expensive. I never wanted to leave BeMe. It was my dream job. But nothing was working out.</p>
<p>We tried shifting to Pune. I got the job at Anubhuti learning center. Similar alternative space like beme. But Nidhi was not getting appropriate job. So we canceled the option.</p>
<p>During that time parents were encouraging me to come back to vadodra, they were feeling lonely, their health were not ok, we wanted to be around them so we can take our marriage conversation forward. So we decided that let&rsquo;s go back to vadodara.</p>
<p>Some how it worked out. I had a talk with Ravi bhai and he offered 1 year grant. I got job as content developer at Pratham Foundation.
Aaakansha also offered 1 year - Escape Velosity Grant to us. So with all of support, we came to Vadodra on 30th April 2024.</p>
<p>Nidhi also got <a href="https://bhoomicollege.org/teach-for-nature-fellowship-fellows">&lsquo;Teach for Nature Fellowship&rsquo;</a> to work in Nature Education in Vadodara.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="engagement---mihir--nidhi">Engagement - Mihir &amp; Nidhi</h3>
<ul>
<li>First thing we did after moving back was event of our formal engagement with friends and family members. It was tough.
10 people coming from Kanpur in train staying in small town like padra, managing whole event, managing everyone&rsquo;s ego - emotions - expectations.. it was tough for me and nidhi both. But we did it. We came out of our comfort zone and did it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Happiest moment was when our friends came to the event and stood with us.</p>
<p><img alt="Friends at Engagement " src="/2024/sagai.JPG"></p>

<li>Nidhi rented out flat and started working with Rameshwari ben and Amit bhai.</li>

<h3 id="work-at-pratham">Work at Pratham</h3>
<p>Pratham was roller coaster experience. In the beginning I was very happy that I got remote job so I can stay in vadodra and also do other work. Secondly it was content development job in environment domain. My team was producing videos for topics like climate change, plastic literacy and more. There was interesting project called creativity club in our account too. Where we need to develop prompt videos for children age 10+ yrs to foster their creativity, collaboration, communication and problem solving skills.</p>
<p>Overall work was interesting but I could sustain there for more than 7 months.</p>
<p>Few reasons :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It was remote team with large scale, deadline driven project. Working in high peace environment with remote team was new experience for me. I didn&rsquo;t feel connected to team and the factory approach which we were using for content development. I felt very disconnected from ground.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my skills were not very good for this type of work environment. I mostly worked with children or teachers. On ground. Never worked with canva - excel - chatgpt. So it was good learning.</p>
<p>I first time wrote script for videos
I first time made posters &amp; videos on canva
I was part of team of the project at this scale for first time where my content goes to thousands of children pan India.</p>
<p>I learnt how to make content for creativity and other 21st century skills. Mainly we were using design thinking activities, replicating already available activities in our format. But making it useful for large scale project is also good learning.</p>
<p>I learnt about how large scale orgs works, I learnt little bit about partnerships and funding</p>
<p>best part of my work was coordinating with nature educators from all over India to nature education camps with children at different location. It was good that I already had network of people in the domain.</p>
<p>I left pratham on 15th Nov 2024. Took few days back break and joined <a href="https://projectdefy.org/">Project DEFY</a> (25th Nov 2024) as subject matter expert - self directed learning. It&rsquo;s 3 months remote assignment.</p>
<p>during pratham days I first time experienced serious anxiety. Stress. Somehow it was very chill for other team members. But I was not handle constant stress, constant communication &amp; coordination.. it was very bad phase.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="finding-work--expectations-from-home">Finding Work &amp; expectations from home</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Aakansha and Ravi bhai offered the grant for the one year. I left the pratham so now we didn&rsquo;t have any backup for money.
most of the pratham&rsquo;s salary is going to be used in marriage event (all the shopping, jewellery and all). Nidhi has some money coming through fellowship but that also she was not able to continue because multiple things going on at home. so we reached out to all social media, all the friends with the <a href="https://learningwala.in/ourneeds/">request</a>. we got many calls from alternative schools from south, many orgs, individuals.</p>
<p>we are very very grateful to all the people who reached out to us with offerings. People who connected us with other people, people who thought about us.</p>
<p>Because of my family situation we need to stay near to vadodra / ahemdabad. My parents wants us to stay near to them. Because of their loneliness, because of their health, because their insecurities , because they feel socially confident when we are around.. for whatever reasons they are not happy about we leaving vadodra and go far from them.</p>
<p>one more aspect to it is they want Nidhi to be house wife kind of person. Helping my mother to do all the work, not taking independent work. My home is based in Patriarchy system. so to stay far from it we need to find work-stay option where we are not very near to them and not very far.</p>
<p>This year very big chunk of my time went to fight and manage the balance of our values and expectations from family. Friends helped me a lot in this. thank you rameshwari ben, mitali ben, many other friends.</p>
<p>Now we are stuck, we have very limited option at vadodra / ahemdabad for meaningful and well paid work. After eliminating many options right now we left with very few :</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Mitali ben&rsquo;s school :</strong> Ravi bhai is willing to continue grant next year also, Aakansha also offered that if I can help her in some admin work of &rsquo;escape velocity grant&rsquo; she can offer grant for one more year. With this assurance we can move to Mitali ben&rsquo;s school 2hrs far from vadodra and work there. Next year we can again search for grant. (Inlaks Grants, The Circle incubation) Also we can find out some part time / remote work if possible.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Pros :</strong> we can work directly with children, we can develop nature education curriculum / do action reasecrh. Nidhi and me can work on our health, we can also be near to my family. We can also work with other orgs in Vadodra because it is just 2hrs away.</p>
<p><strong>Cons :</strong> Instability of funding, we might feel lonely sometime in village.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Gopaldham learning center :</strong> it is an Ashramshala in Jashdan near rajkot / chotila. 5hrs from vadodra. they are looking for school leader kind of person.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Pros :</strong> there are only 70 children, we will get full freedom to do meaningful work. We both will get work. Good payment also</p>
<p><strong>Cons :</strong> this is new place. We don&rsquo;t know the founders and team personally. No friends, we will feel lonely. We need to leave work we have started in vadodra</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Balgokulam :</strong> it is an early childhood research org based in ahemdabad.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Pro :</strong> good salary. My role will direct working with children and researching about early childhood curriculum. so new learning opportunity. we can come to vadodara when ever is needed, it is just 2hrs</p>
<p><strong>Cons :</strong> new set up don&rsquo;t know what exactly my role looks like. It is new org started in 2023 so don&rsquo;t know the future. We will need to find job for nidhi.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Eklavya, Bhopal :</strong> with Aakansha&rsquo;s funding we can go eklavya bhopal and start working there with libraries. I am not sure that ravi bhai will give funding for that.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Pros :</strong> Eklavya family will be there, lots of new people, friends, projects</p>
<p><strong>Cons :</strong> instability of funding. We need to leave our work which we started in vadodra. We might not get access to children like school. Because we will work with libraries.</p>
<p>I am eliminating BLR right now but we have shortlisted some org if we want to go : creative school, beme, project DEFY, seed to sapling, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="health">Health</h3>
<ul>
<li>Me &amp; Nidhi both went to Nephropathy this year at Nisargupchar Kendra - Gotri, Vadodra. It is wonderful place.
I am suffering from stomach problems and Nidhi is suffering from skin - hair issues. (apart from our mental health) We tried following the diet for month or two.. it was magical.. it works. eating millets and doing yoga. After one point of time it got difficult for us to manage the routine and making food at home. but we want to start it again when we get new place to stay and work. This year I want to start doing regular exercise &amp; eating healthy food. (This very basic and obvious thing but very hard to do )</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="golu">Golu</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nidhi&rsquo;s brother Tanishk aka golu was also there with us in Vadodra for few months. Nidhi invited him to take break after his 12th exam and explore options other than joining privet engineering collage. It was mistake&hellip; we were not ready. it was difficult to make some one self directed learner in short time. Also against his will. It was good learning for us to see what is happening inside us when situation like this come on our face. what happens inside us? , can we empathize ? it was tough time for me personally.</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t find meaning in this type of exploration time, he became phone - game addict, he bought new iphone and it was game changer for him&hellip; in short some mistake from our side, some expectation from his side.. it didn&rsquo;t work out. I was so happy when he went back home. I was genuinely concerned and still I am concerned about his future. I never thought bad about him but our expectation didn&rsquo;t match. We were super busy in our work we really didn&rsquo;t give proper time to him&hellip; it was wrong timing.</p>

<h3 id="reflections--proudest-moments-of-the-year-things-you-dont-like-about-this-year-something-you-learnt-about-yourself">Reflections : Proudest moments of the year, Things you don&rsquo;t like about this year, something you learnt about yourself</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our work got recognized : <a href="https://www.early-bird.in/meet-an-educator-mihir-pathak/">ebird - meet the educator article</a> - feeling proud.</li>
<li>I could manage to do local khoji event even with the stress and work load of pratham. I could have done better if I have time. I really didn&rsquo;t get time for the facilitating the project.</li>
<li>We (Nidhi, Mihir, Impana) managed to do &lsquo;A matter of time&rsquo; exhibition. I was on cloud 7 :)</li>
<li>This year I wrote regular <a href="https://learningwala.in/tags/weekly-notes/">weekly notes</a> on my website from week 12 to week 52 = 40 weeks = 10 months. I never thought that I will continue this habit. But I did. I am proud of it.</li>
<li>In first week of Dec I visited BLR to attend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DDd2w5movCJ/?img_index=1">wipro partners</a> (my reflections) forum and meeting children at BeMe. Meeting children from 12+ group was a joy for me.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="BeMe Children " src="/2024/beme.jpeg"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This year was very stressful and I felt serious anxiety many a times. Because of nature of work at Pratha,Home / family issues</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This year I first time tried fund raising. I pitched our work and managed to raised 9L rupees for a year from individual donors. I am very very grateful to them for trusting us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I did session with corporate team for first time. Thank you Mitali ben for co- facilitating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This year I contributed / spent big amount of grant money and pratham&rsquo;s salary money for marriage prep, which I didn&rsquo;t like. I wanted to use that money for children or save it for future. Any way I am happy that we did camp from that money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This year also I am part of Child Development and learning course at Eklavya. I co facilitated sessions this time. After the physical workshop we as team to need to be more active to respond the participant&rsquo;s need. But I felt that other team members are busy with other work and not able to give priority to this. It is frustrating for me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This year we (Nidhi and Mihir) took many workshops and sessions with different age groups. In 2025 we want to take up one project and do deeper work in that. We will take up the project of developing curriculum for Nature Detective program (age 3 to 11yrs) and for older age group we will work with children from sai&rsquo;s angel foundation. We will also plan to do action research kind of thing with Nature Classroom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I took logistic responsibility for the residential camps we did this year. I invited Nidhi, Nishtha and Prerna for facilitation. It was a good experience for me. I learnt about my self that I enjoy doing this type of work also</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea of sangha - tribe - community got stronger in mind this year. I learnt that if you want to walk on this path of alternatives you need strong sangha.. and you need to selflessly contribute in that sangha</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This year tested my and nidhi&rsquo;s bonding.. hard time.. stress.. things we hated came back to us&hellip;but we are strong &amp; together. Thank you so much Nidhi for being you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All these years I was very confused about my offering in education. I am not a subject teacher, I am not a teacher trainer, I don&rsquo;t want to start NGO to scale things.. what exactly I want to do ? This year I got some answers :</p>

<h3 id="what-next-">What next ?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Work front : till 15th March 2025 - Project DEFY&rsquo;s work is there.</li>
<li>Need to figure out work after that. Gopaldham and Balgokulam people will reply in mid Jan. After that we will take a call. I am mostly inclined towards going to mitali ben&rsquo;s school for 1 year and then going back to BLR / stay back if we get regular funding. If we go to mitali ben&rsquo;s school, we will take up curriculum development project for nature detective and also collaborate with nature classroom for action research &amp; material development.</li>
<li>I want to continue work in vadodara. Specially with sai&rsquo;s angel foundation. We (Rameshwari ben , Ashish bhai, Saurabh bhai, Nikita ben, Suraj, Mihir &amp; Nidhi) started one fellowship program for teenager. It&rsquo;s kind of swaraj university model / beme model / self directed learning / relationship model. It was a longest wish to do this type of work with youth. I am looking forward to that.</li>
</ul>

<p>After writing this much I still feel I missed something..but it&rsquo;s ok. I will update here if I remember something.

<p>Till now I have seen two episodes.</p>
<p>Kalish Nadh (CTO, Zerodha)
Jacob Singh (CTO in Residence for Sequoia Capital in South East Asia and India)</p>
<p>I like both the episodes so much. Apart from tech both the episodes were filled with philosophies. Here I would like to share one thought shared by Jacob about motivation for the work.</p>
<p>He shared that intrinsic motivation for work comes from three things :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Autonomy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mastry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connectedness / Purpose</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Here you go :</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEZMSbeziEw&t=870s">14:30</a> What motivates engineers?</p>
<p><strong>Full episode :</strong></p>

      <description>It was raining. I was traveling from Vadodara to Padra by local bus. In front of me, some college students were talking about their final year project ideas.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;If madam had let us leave earlier, we would have reached home sooner in this rain.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to work on any project now. I gave such a great idea, but madam directly rejected it. Does that idea come in handy in such rain?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was raining. I was traveling from Vadodara to Padra by local bus. In front of me, some college students were talking about their final year project ideas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If madam had let us leave earlier, we would have reached home sooner in this rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to work on any project now. I gave such a great idea, but madam directly rejected it. Does that idea come in handy in such rain? People who have empty cars are offering seats to others. If we create such an app, car owners will know who else needs a ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but these types of apps are already there, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I&rsquo;m talking about a local app.
Another great idea was an app for men&rsquo;s customized clothes. But madam wouldn’t even listen to it. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I also suggested a game idea, and she did the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>Let’s stop judging these students&rsquo; ideas and talk about their college teacher instead.</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of listening to the students&rsquo; ideas and giving constructive feedback, she directly rejects them, saying it’s not possible.</li>
<li>She insults students in class in front of everyone.</li>
</ul>
<p>This behavior crushes the self-esteem and confidence of the students. We need teachers who allow young people to share new ideas freely. When they receive support without fear, their creativity can flourish. Remember these young people are entrepreneur of tomorrow</p>

<p>She called me to share that she is going to do ‘nature bingo’ and ‘web of life’ activity with her class as part of geography class.</p>
<p>Her teacher gave a task to explain some topics from the textbook in a hands-on manner.
This girl took the opportunity to introduce the wonder of nature to her classmates.</p>
<p>She made my day by sharing this.</p>
<p>This is the butterfly effect for me</p>
<p>If you provide a locally relevant direct experiences + provide safe space to flourish
Young people can do wonders.</p>
<p>Local khoji and many many other organization and initiatives working with youth, environment, citizenship - are BIG hope for me.</p>

      <description>How can I build something which helps young people thrive ? What helped me? What are the key differentiators which help to achieve escape velocity ? What enables people to live a self - directed life ? if we see youth as change makers, citizens and future of india then we need to support young people&#xA;to achieve the skills they need for this rapidly changing world, community and belongingness</description>

<li>How can I build something which helps young people thrive ?</li>
<li>What helped me?</li>
<li>What are the key differentiators which help to achieve escape velocity ?</li>
<li>What enables people to live a self - directed life ?</li>
</ul>
<p>if we see youth as change makers, citizens and future of india then we need to support young people</p>
<p>to achieve the skills they need for this rapidly changing world, community and belongingness</p>
<p>think about the 16 year old boy or girl from small city like Vadodara, middle class family</p>
<ul>
<li>got typical education from school</li>
<li>no idea what career options / study options are available apart from typical sci, commerce and arts streams</li>
<li>no self confidence, very little self worth, no particular interests or ambition</li>
<li>easily get influenced by advertisements and media. No critical thinking lens</li>
</ul>
<p>In my journey what are the differentiators ?</p>
<p>the foundation is same but,</p>
<p>I got the opportunity to work on real life projects
I met people + spaces who don&rsquo;t judge, believe in you and give you the platform. Which ultimately become my tribe / community</p>
<p>How can I create this for friends and peers in Vadodara and my hometown Padra ?</p>
<p>Can project based learning become a starting point ?</p>
<p>Do one research / making / solving/entrepreneurship project around your city. Your questions, your ideas.</p>
<p>I will connect you with subject matter expert, will fund your project, will connect you with further opportunity  (internship / course / job / funding / learning)</p>
<p>This gives you non judgemental space, self confidence, you work in team, express yourself creatively and much more.</p>
<p>after the project done you becomes part of khoji community and keep doing interesting stuff</p>
<p>we will try to guide you for career opportunity, other learning opportunities</p>
<p>Local khoji is a distillation of ideas which I have been dreaming of for years.
Give unconventional, transformative learning experience to children.</p>
<p>This is not a CSR project / Not a NGO, it is just an initiative. I am very much open for collaboration
I am ready to share all my learnings / ideas / support  if you want to start local khoji at your town, your org, your school, your community. It can fit in your existing programs, curriculum and timetables.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been 11 years now working in the education sector. I worked with children age 3yrs to 18yrs. Schools from state board to IB boards. Homeschooling groups and alternative schools too..</p>
<p>for the last few years I got interested in working with teenagers or youth.</p>
<ul>
<li>How to give a platform to youth to thrive ?</li>
<li>How to give opportunities where they can build their agency</li>
<li>how they can be self directed learner and foster life skills</li>
<li>how they engage in local environment and civic problems</li>
</ul>
<p>These are some of my goals when I say working with youth.</p>
<p>As a self -directed learner I saw that you need two very strong pillars to build your journey.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>non judgmental safe space + mentor/friend/peers who can challenge you, give reflective tools to you. Basically your tribe, who trust you, believe in you no matter how good you are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exposure, Projects, Challenges, Things which helps you to shift your orbit
These are the two main things which I believe are game changers. I saw multiple organizations working on the same design.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I want to spend the next 10 years of my life on this problem. What will be my intervention design ?</p>
<ul>
<li>can we design a program where children can do real life project</li>
<li>where children can opportunity to think, work in team, find mentors and more</li>
</ul>
<p>What should be the context ? Theme ?</p>
<p>Can we give the local environment and civic as a theme ?
If you merge it all together :</p>
<p>Local khoji - a platform for children to conduct original and authentic inquiry projects about the cities they live in.</p>
<p>Children can different type of projects - research projects, making projects, story project rooted in place they live.</p>
<p>This will be a 3 to 4 month journey, according to how much time school / NGO / learning centers give to work on the project.</p>
<p>This program design is very much inspired by Solve Ninja (Reap Benefit) and City as lab - Mumbai (@cityaslabindia)</p>
<p>What happened after this intervention ? children who were involved in can start a club called ‘Khoji club’ which will become a incubator / Adda kind of place for children. There will be different events happening, reading - making - movie screening - talks and lots of fun.</p>
<p>I want to make the whole process open source so anybody can run local khoji and khoji clubs at their own place. And I want to focus on more innovative ideas. I don’t want to run as a typical NGO / org but more like a laboratory where I constantly work on ideas to re imagine learning.</p>

      <description>Recently I read the ASER ‘Byond Basics’ report. It is all about young adults age 14 to 18yrs&#xA;Do they have technology access / smart phone What are their aspirations Can they read and do basic maths All these questions will give a window to a world of possibilities. How are they using smartphones and for what purpose ? Do they use it for learning ? If not, how can we encourage them to do that?</description>

<p>All these questions will give a window to a world of possibilities. How are they using smartphones and for what purpose ? Do they use it for learning ? If not, how can we encourage them to do that?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Smartphones are a great equlazirer but contentwise we are competing with youtube. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What type of content we should publish in this situation </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can we ask youth what they want?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How are you looking at learning happening outside the school ?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These all are questions to the window of possibilities. I read the report and some other articles. I am writing some insights which I got reflecting on them. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We need to have dialgue with youth about what they want </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only creating content and putting it in the air will not work, we need to make the whole ecosystem of learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can blame or expect schools to teach everything we need to look at the needs of this age group outside the school structure. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need to create informal learning spaces where young people can come, talk, and explore freely. (The youth wants a space to share their feelings, anxieties, and fears about the future.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second step can be nudging them for some learning - challenging activities where smartphones or technology can play a bigger role. But that one on one connect, guidance, mentorship is important </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s take one scenario : </p>
<p>You started one youth program where young people join and teach children. Through this program you started one ‘youth adda’ where young people can come freely to talk - hangout. </p>
<p>Slowly you made genuine friendship with them, now they are open for your ideas and guidance.</p>
<p>You suggested they do one short course on ‘financial literacy’ so they can manage their finances well. Now high quilty content is important.</p>
<p>Youtube is winning because it is no brainer. You don’t need to think to see insta reels or youtube shots. You need brain, motivation and many other factors to see ‘learning content’</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One way is, make your learning content in format of shots and influncere kind of videos. Like Vlogs and more. There are chances that you need to dilute your content to add those types of mirch masala.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second way is to build an ecosystem which encourages and nudges us to explore ‘learning content’ apart from those nobrainers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s talk about Ankur wariku. He is making videos on financial literacy. Apart from making videos he is doing insta live with people to help them to learn ‘how to invest in their given salary’</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>He is building a community. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He is taking subjects which very very relevant to young people </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe we need to do both things in balance. We need to make our content more engaging and on the other side we need to build an ecosystem around it. </p>
<p>There are some more insights about vocational training and basic reading and maths </p>
<p>Which I will write some other time. </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have never bought new laptop in my life. I had P4 computer at home around 2008 - 9
After that when I dropped out of school and started working in different organisation, people helped me with their old laptops.</p>
<p>My first laptop was <strong>Asuse eee pc</strong>. I was using it with <strong>Ubuntu &amp; openSUSE</strong> later on..</p>
<p><img alt="Asuse eee pc" src="/laptop/eee.png">
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Asuse eee pc with <a href="https://makeymakey.com/">makey makey circuit</a></p>
<p>I remember going to Jigish Bhai&rsquo;s office and making live USB boot for openSUSE Linux distro. That was my first introduction to open source &amp; free software world. My mama Nirmal Pathak is fedora contributor. I remember reading Kartik Bhai&rsquo;s blog about debian &amp; Wikipedia. Doing wikipedia meetup at goraj muni seva ashram.</p>
<p>samyak bhai introduced me to markdown, git and world of developer :)</p>
<hr>
<p>When I went to dharampur few friends donated 2 - 3 laptops for our school.</p>
<ul>
<li>Toshiba - Vaibhav Pandya</li>
<li>Samsung - Jubin Mehta</li>
<li>Samsung (silver) - Shruti</li>
<li>ASUSE - chirag patel</li>
</ul>
<p>All the laptop were very old, their parts stopped working one by one (like screen, keyboard, battery, etc) accept Samsung (silver) one. When I went to Bhuj one visitor at our school gifted <strong>old macbook air 2013 model</strong>. It was in pretty good condition. I swapped samsung silver with that and started using it.</p>
<p>Since then I am using it as my primary machine. Writing, web browsing, teaching MIT Scratch to children, many other tinkering.. I changed the battery few months ago.</p>
<p><img alt="Macbook Air 2013" src="/laptop/mac.png">
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
( Macbook Air 2013 )</p>
<p>In 2021 Srishti gifted her old macbook air to me. I was using it with children on and off. When Nidhi needed laptop I gave it her. But unfortunately battery of that machine got swelled like balloon. It is difficult to open the body and change it.</p>
<p>Now I gave my macbook air to her and decided to buy new - refurbished laptop.</p>
<p>After some research 2 friends suggested to check out the work of Abhas Abhinav founder of Mostly harmless computers. He is FOSS enthusiast - activist - technologist - hardware hacker - geek. He runs a libretech.shop - a ethical source for libre and liberated hardware products.</p>
<p>I visited his office. It was nostalgia for me to dive in to the world of FOSS again. This time Nidhi was also there. I was happy to introduce her to this philosophy..</p>
<p><strong>Abhas bhai gifted me a book called &lsquo;code swaraj&rsquo; which is in my reading list.</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Code Swaraj" src="/laptop/book.jpeg">
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><strong>he also gifted mostlly harmless USB dive with around 13 type of linux distro</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Thinkpad X1 Carbon" src="/laptop/usb.jpeg">
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>From his recommendation I met Ved who runs refurbished laptop shop in banaswadi.
After so much of comparing and testing I finally bought refurbished Thinkpad X1 Carbon 6th Gen (Intel i7 8th Gen, 16GB RAM, 512 HDD)</p>
<p><img alt="Thinkpad X1 Carbon" src="/laptop/thinkpad.jpeg">
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h3 id="my-criteria-was">My criteria was</h3>
<ul>
<li>repairablity</li>
<li>possiblity to upgrade (RAM, CPU)</li>
<li>portabilty (light weight)</li>
<li>feature proof</li>
<li>compatable with linux / free bios</li>
</ul>
<p>Thinkpad X1C is not true for all criteria. Number 1 yes, 2 no , 3 big yes, 4 yes, 5 yes - linux can run very nicely but the bios is not free you can&rsquo;t do core boot. You can&rsquo;t upgrade RAM. But solution I am thinking is after 5 - 6 years of usage I can again sell it to refurbished shop and upgrade the machine.</p>
<p>Tjesh GN, Aditya, Kartik bhai, Nirmal bhai and Suchakra helped a lot take the disison. Thank you so much.</p>
<p>So <strong>welcome to family - Thinkpad X1 Carbon - 2nd March 2024</strong></p>
<p>During this process I read a lot about FOSS and again visited <a href="kartikm.wordpress.com">Kartik bhai</a> &amp; <a href="https://thejeshgn.com/">Thejesh&rsquo;s blog</a>. I amazed with the power of community in FOSS and really wish to see that in education sector.</p>

      <description>Chapter 1 I started my first blog around 2012 from one cyber cafe. It was very fascinating for me at that time.&#xA;I can put something on the computer and the whole world can see. More than blogging it was about the whole website technology was fascinating for me.&#xA;Instead of going to school I used to roam around different offices/ shops who make websites for small businesses. I visit them as customers and ask too many questions&amp;hellip; later on I did a market job with them in exchange for learning from their developer.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h2>
<p>I started my first blog around 2012 from one cyber cafe. It was very fascinating for me at that time.<br>
I can put something on the computer and the whole world can see. More than blogging it was about the whole website technology was fascinating for me.</p>
<p>Instead of going to school I used to roam around different offices/ shops who make websites for small businesses. I visit them as customers and ask too many questions&hellip; later on I did a market job with them in exchange for learning from their developer.</p>
<p>I learn about static - dynamic websites, CMS (wordpress, Dhrupal, Jhoomla), some basics about HTML CSS and PHP, what is domain, what is hosting and server. And most importantly how to do business of developing websites - profit margins and other stuff.</p>
<p>My first blog/website was called &lsquo;<strong>Pathak Technologies</strong>&rsquo;. Small web development firm<br>
it was on <strong>blogger/blogspot.com</strong></p>
<h2 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h2>
<p>Around 2013 I moved to wordpress. At that time there was a big Gujarati blogger community on wordpress. Most of them are sitting in the USA or Canada and blogging about their retired life :)<br>
I remember Suresh dada&rsquo;s blog, Vinod bhai blog&hellip;</p>
<p>I also remember reading <a href="https://hirals.wordpress.com/">Hiral ben</a>, <a href="https://kartikm.wordpress.com/">Kartik bhai</a>, <a href="https://nirmalpathak.wordpress.com/">Nirmal bhai&rsquo;s blogs</a>.</p>
<p>I was running three blogs at that time -</p>
<ul>
<li>my personal blog called &lsquo;<a href="https://mihirism.wordpress.com/">Mihirism</a>&rsquo;</li>
<li>blog called <a href="https://sureshbjani.wordpress.com/2013/10/24/laboratory/">&lsquo;Prayog Ghar&rsquo;</a> about science &amp; technology in simple language</li>
<li>&lsquo;<a href="https://kelavani.wordpress.com/">Sanistha kelavani</a>&rsquo; about Nai taleem education</li>
<li>I was contributing on &lsquo;<a href="http://evidyalay.net/">Evidyalay</a>&rsquo;</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Medium" src="/blogging/medium.png">
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><em><strong>it was wonderful learning time</strong></em></p>
<h2 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h2>
<p>I remember samyak bhai introduced me to markdown, git and something called &lsquo;<a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a>&rsquo; :)</p>
<p><em><strong>Medium was very new and silk that time. super clean writing focused blogging platform.</strong></em></p>
<p>I liked it immediately and made <a href="https://medium.com/@learningwala">my profile</a>. <strong>My last post on Medium was on Nov- 2023</strong></p>
<p>I wrote about my classroom experiences / learning experiments with children and teachers, I wrote about some interesting resources I found for educators / interesting stuff around pedagogy and more. mostly centred around education, philosophy and pedagogy . Sometimes some personal stuff like poems or life as an educator..</p>
<p><strong>in between, around 2015</strong></p>
<p>we (<a href="https://www.lakhan.me/">lakhan samani</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kash9350">kashyap</a> helped me a lot. very grateful for that - Thank you guys) have made &rsquo;learnlabs&rsquo; website in PHP</p>
<p><strong>Around 2018</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://jubinsblog.com/">Jubin</a> introduced me to wix.com - I made first version on &rsquo;learningwala.com&rsquo; on that</p>
<p><strong>I was using it till 2022</strong></p>
<p>During that time I shifted my blogging journey on <a href="https://instagram.com/learningwala">instagram</a>.</p>
<p>Mostly because I was getting community over there. Educators, Artist and more. I mostly put posts about my experiments with children, workshops I am conducting with teachers, books I am reading, inspiring educators and more.</p>
<p><strong>till now 839 posts, 1132 followers</strong></p>
<p>oh, I forgot about facebook. I have been active on FB since 2010 (Remember UC Browser ??) till I got instagram. After instagram, facebook is running on auto pilot. All instagram posts auto publish on FB.</p>
<p>I tried IFTTT before this instagram feature came.</p>
<ul>
<li>I made some very good connections through <a href="https://instagram.com/learningwala">instagram</a> and facebook.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="chapter-4">Chapter 4</h2>
<p>After leaving wix for my personal website I shifted my stuff (projects, writing, CV, etc) on <a href="https://linktr.ee/learningwala">linktree</a>.</p>
<p>I made websites for friends on wix and still maintain it.</p>
<p>Since the last few months I have had the desire to start my blogging journey again. With more categories in writing like weekly notes, ideas for project based learning / nature based learning and some other experiments.</p>
<p><strong>Medium is now paid for. You can&rsquo;t read unlimited stories.</strong> I started exploring other platforms<br>
Ghost, Wordpress, there is a long list of minimal blogging platforms. Some are giving self hosting facilities.</p>
<p>I was looking for a super minimal platform where I can just write posts and I have control on my data.<br>
no advertisement, monetisation of posts, no social network around blog, - just writing place</p>
<p>Someone suggested trying <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and Github pages. It was too geeky for me. I tried two - three themes but never started writing on it.</p>
<p>I found something called <a href="bearblog.dev">bearblog.dev</a></p>
<p>Basically, someone developed a back-end to update your static site. It is perfect for minimal blogging<br>
but it is not available for self hosting, what if this project got stopped ? What if the product strategy of this platform changes ?</p>
<p>But I really like the theme. I searched more and luckily I found the same theme on github which was available self hosting on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a> / <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">netlify</a> / your own server.</p>
<p>Finally I saw two youtube videos and learned how to set it. <strong>And yes I am writing on the same platform :)</strong></p>
<h2 id="low-tech-website">Low tech website</h2>
<p><em>This website too simple, ugly, no modern features</em></p>
<p>And no Js, No cookies, no tracker, fast, clean, functional, you own the data, you can develop in your own ways, less energy usage, less computing power usage</p>
<p><strong>let&rsquo;s find why, what and How about low tech website :</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.resilience.org/stories/2018-09-27/how-to-build-a-low-tech-website/">- How to Build a Low-tech Website?</a></p>
<p><a href="https://lente.dev/en/posts/stone-websites/">- Stone websites</a></p>
<p><a href="https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/">- This Page is Designed to Last</a></p>
<p><strong>My ultimate dream is to host my own static site on solar powered raspberry pi<br>
someday I will do it for sure.</strong></p>
<p>Thank you</p>
