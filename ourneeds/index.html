Me &amp; my partner Nidhi are looking for a long term working opportunity at a learning space / alternative school / NGO.
We both love working with children and we are primarily &rsquo;learning facilitators&#39;.
We are looking for a working opportunity where we can work directly with children.
Our keen interest is on building human to human relationships acknowledging one’s inner strengths and uniqueness. Supporting an individual getting to connect with their potential rather then having self judgement, comparative behavior or need of external validation for any work performance." />

<p><strong>Our Needs :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>we both never worked in the corporate sector, we are trusting the universe and working in alternate spaces from the beginning of our career. So we do not have savings, on the other side we need to support our parents also. So we have financial needs.If we are living in a city like Bangalore or Pune in a rented house. We need a salary of 50 k per month (individually). If learning space is providing a place to live &amp; food. We will be able to manage in 30 k per month (individually).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We want to be in a community. The alternate path is a lonely path. We need &lsquo;Sangha&rsquo;. Sangha to share our joy, share our hopes, share our sadness, space for self reflection and more</p>
</li>
</ul>
