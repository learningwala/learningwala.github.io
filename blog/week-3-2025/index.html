<p>13th Jan : Dhara and Bharat went back to their home town.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>14th Jan : me and Nidhi came to padra, celebrated Makarsankranti with family. It was first makarsankrati of Nidhi. She saw this type of festival, flying kites at this scale for first time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>on 15th night nidhi needs to catch the train to Kanpur. She needs to do lots of packing. So mummy papa came to drop us at nidhi&rsquo;s place.</p>
<p>Nidhi requested that she need help in packing so I also went at her place.
whole day she did packing and I gave her a company.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>15th night mummy, papa, and me went to station to drop nidhi. Now we will directly meet in marriage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>16th Jan - in evening I have attended online call by Shishir bhai about current state of vishwamitri river and how we can do something about it. I am planning to write separate post about the same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>17, 18 - mostly office work</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Recived gift from Antara - 17th Jan</p>
<p><img alt="Gift" src="/w3.2025/gift.jpeg"></p>
<p>Me and Nidhi are thinking about giving proper name and visual identity to our nature education work. Learningwala is there but nidhi is feeling that, it is my brand and my work, she is not feeling that she is part of it. So we have decided to create something new whcih we both can hold and nurture.</p>
<p>I was thinking about different names.. KhojBeen Mandali suck to my mind. Nidhi also liked it. I started reaching out to people seeking help in visual identity. Rachita called me and gave some ideas about how to start. I had a chat with Ipsa Jain, Ashra, Nipun Prabhakar, Jinal, Chaitali and few other folks about the same.</p>

<p><strong>Overall mood and other things</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>overall I am happy. Work at DEFY is going well.</li>
<li>I am happy that my and nidhi&rsquo;s friends are coming to our wedding</li>
<li>after elementing all the options we have decided to go to Mitali ben&rsquo;s school from march. Gopaldham option is still open, today morning only I had call with Varun. He is ready to accommodate both of us with sallry we are expecting. The only thing is it is very remote area and we will feel alone. Here mitali ben is there, vadodra is near by so it will work out. I told varun that we will meet after 15th feb. We will visit the school so we can get idea.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mostly we will take a risk and go to mitali ben&rsquo;s school :)</p>
<p><strong>Current Focus</strong></p>

<li>Sakha Fellowship</li>
<li>Balvikas course</li>
