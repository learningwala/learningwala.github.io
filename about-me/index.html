  <p>I craft transformative learning journeys for children and young adults, through experiential methodologies.</p>
<p>I believe that school kills creativity, self-esteem, and most importantly, sensitivity in individuals, which has larger implications on society.</p>
<p>I am passionate about co-creating learning journeys with young adults, fostering safe, dialogic spaces, sharing reflective tools, and inviting them for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoE480mzrk0">‘self-directed learning’</a>.</p>

<p>Facilitating theatre and outdoor/nature-based experiential learning programs, projects, residential camps, yatra, internships, weekly meetups, and more.</p>
<p>With a decade of experience, I consult for a number of learning spaces across India.</p>
<p>At times, I engage in educational content, curriculum, and product development. While it&rsquo;s not always fun or meaningful, I appreciate the creative process and the opportunity to apply my experience with children and teachers.</p>
<p>As an amateur writer, I enjoy crafting poetry and aspire to write stories, poems, and plays for children. So far, I have self-published two books in Gujarati.</p>
<p>When I’m not with children or educators, I immerse myself in writing poetry or documenting my ’learning experiments'.</p>
<p>Music, long walks, bird watching, singing, and sketching are my favorite time accelerators.</p>
