<p>I believe that sharing one&rsquo;s passion, providing reflective tools to children, and fostering an environment for dialogue and self-directed learning can be truly transformative.</p>
<p><strong>I am interested in :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nature / Climate Education</li>
<li>Interdisciplinary Project based - self directed - Experiential Learning</li>
<li>Life Skills and Socio Emotional Learning</li>
<li>Dialogue based - Transformative learning</li>
<li>Mentoring teenagers for designing their own learning Journeys &amp; making portfolio</li>
<li>Citizen science - open data - civic engagement projects,</li>
<li>Creative writing - art - theater - design and technology</li>

<p>When I&rsquo;m not with children or educators, I immerse myself in writing poetry or documenting my &rsquo;learning experiments&rsquo; with children.</p>
<p>Music, Long walks, Bird watching, singing and sketching are my favorite time accelerators.</p>
