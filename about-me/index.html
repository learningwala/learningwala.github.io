<p>I believe that modern education system is a fraudulent system of learning, whose purpose is to convert beautiful diverse human beings into robot-like &ldquo;human resources&rdquo; and into stupid global consumers. (→ <a href="https://shikshantar.org/articles/10-lies-my-school-taught-me">10 lies school taught me</a>)</p>
<p><strong>I craft transformative learning journeys for children and young adults.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In contemporary societies, we must learn to negotiate and act on our own purposes, values, feelings, and meanings rather than those we have uncritically assimilated from others — to gain greater control over our lives as socially responsible, clearthinking decision makers.” (Mezirow, 2012).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>I believe that transformative learning happens through human relationships, dialogs, powerful experiences &amp; reflections.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Transformative learning is the expansion of consciousness through the transformation of basic worldview and specific capacities of the self. (Elias, 1997)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>I am passionate about co-creating dialogic spaces with children &amp; young adults.
Where we share creative adventures, tools for reflection, and invite them for &lsquo;journey of growth&rsquo;.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Learning does not happen through teaching; it happens through meeting. — Martin Buber</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Intention to action :</strong></p>
<p>I am trying to facilitate transformative learning through tools I discovered during my journey :</p>
<ul>
<li>Interdisciplinary projects / Project based learning</li>
<li>Movement &amp; Theater based programs</li>
<li>Nature / Outdoor based programs</li>
</ul>
<p>Residential camps, Yatras, Internships, Weekly meetups, developing informal learning spaces (Clubs, Maker Space, Library, Studio) and more.</p>
<p>With a decade of experience, I consult for a number of learning spaces across India.</p>
<hr>
<p>At times, I engage in educational content, curriculum, and product development. While it&rsquo;s not always fun or meaningful, I appreciate the creative process and the opportunity to apply my experience with children and teachers.</p>
<p>As an amateur writer, I enjoy crafting poetry and aspire to write stories, poems, and plays for children. So far, I have self-published two books in Gujarati.</p>
<p>When I’m not with children or educators, I immerse myself in writing poetry or documenting my ’learning experiments&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Music, long walks, bird watching, singing, and sketching are my favorite time accelerators.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Highlights from my learning journey:</strong></p>
