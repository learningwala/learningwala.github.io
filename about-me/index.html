<p>Hi, This is Mihir Pathak aka learningwala</p>
<p>I am passionate educator.</p>
<p>I never been to formal school after completing 10th grade. Later, I completed my 12th grade and pursued a BA in Sociology as an external student. I am working with children since the age of 18.</p>
<p>During this decade long journey, I worked in a formal &amp; informal learning spaces. Worked with children directly, shared my understanding of education and pedagogy with teachers, developed content, curricula &amp; more.</p>
<p>My core interests areas are understanding &lsquo;The role of love &amp; Relationship in education&rsquo;, Self directed learning &amp; non formal learning spaces, Child development &amp; learning, language pedagogy and children literature, life skills education and ecological consciousness / nature education.</p>
<p>My work is deeply inspired by the philosophies of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiddu_Krishnamurti">J. Krishnamurti</a>, <a href="https://infed.org/mobi/martin-buber-on-education/">Martin Buber</a> , and the science of brain, learning, and child development.</p>
<p><strong>I create transformative learning journeys for children, young adults and educators using experiential methodologies, including theater, nature-based explorations, and interdisciplinary projects.</strong></p>
<p>I am part of the faculty team for the <a href="https://www.eklavya.in/about-us-eklavya/what-we-do-eklavya-new/courses-and-workshops/child-development-special-needs-and-learning-a-certificate-course">&lsquo;Child Development, Learning &amp; Special Needs&rsquo;</a> course at Eklavya Foundation, Bhopal. and a proud recipient of the Earth Educator Fellowship (2022-23), supported by the <a href="https://www.youcan.in/">Youth Conservation Action Network</a>.</p>
<p>As an amateur writer, I enjoy crafting poetry and aspire to write stories, poems, and plays for children. So far, I have self-published two books in Gujarati.</p>
<p>When I’m not with children or educators, I immerse myself in writing poetry or documenting my ’learning experiments&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Music, long walks, bird watching, singing, and sketching are my favorite time accelerators.</p>
