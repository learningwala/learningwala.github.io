<p><strong>I craft transformative learning journeys with children and young adults through experiential methodologies:</strong></p>
<p>I am working with children, young adults and educators since last 11 years. I have worked with a formal &amp; informal learning spaces during this journey.</p>
<p>My core interest is developing life skills &amp; environmental consciousnesses through theater, outdoor &amp; interdisciplinary project based transformative experiences.</p>
<p>I also work with teenagers as companion in their self directed journey / gap year</p>
<p>Inspired from the philosophy of J.Krishnmurti, Martin Buber &amp; science of child development I work with educators to help them to create transformative learning experiences in their context/learning spaces.</p>
<p>When I’m not with children or educators, I immerse myself in writing poetry or documenting my ’learning experiments'.</p>
<p>Music, long walks, bird watching, singing, and sketching are my favorite time accelerators.</p>
